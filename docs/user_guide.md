## Ticker Modifiers
You can use Testfol modifiers in the ticker symbol to simulate leverage or expense ratios:

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `?L=X` | **Leverage**: Multiplies daily returns by X. | `SPY?L=2` (2x S&P 500) |
| `?D=X` | **Drag**: Applies annual drag (expense ratio). | `SPY?D=0.50` (0.50% fee) |
| `_SIM` | **Simulation**: Often used to extend history. | `UPRO_SIM` (Simulated 3x SPY) |
