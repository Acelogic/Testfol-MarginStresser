                                  HIGHLIGHTS

Nasdaq-100 Shares(SM) are Ownership Interests in the Nasdaq-100 Trust

     The Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust
that issues securities called Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock (also referred to
in this Prospectus as "Nasdaq-100 Shares"). The Trust is a unit investment trust
organized under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust is governed by a
trust agreement (the "Trust Agreement") between The Bank of New York, a
corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York with trust powers
(the "Trustee"), and Nasdaq Global Funds, Inc. (the "Sponsor"), dated and
executed as of March 4, 1999, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Trust
Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2001, and by Amendment No. 2 to the Trust
Agreement, dated as of February 4, 2004. Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock
represents undivided ownership interests in the portfolio of stocks held by the
Trust. The Trust holds all of the component securities of the Nasdaq-100 Index
(the "Index").

Nasdaq-100 Shares Should Generally Correspond to the Value of the Underlying
Nasdaq-100 Index

     The investment objective of the Trust is to provide investment results that
generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Index (the
component securities of the Index are sometimes referred to herein as "Index
Securities"). There can be no assurance that this investment objective will be
met fully.

     The Trust holds the Portfolio and cash and is not actively managed by
traditional methods, which typically involve effecting changes in the Portfolio
on the basis of judgments made relating to economic, financial and market
considerations. To maintain the correspondence between the composition and
weights of the securities in the Trust (the "Securities") and the stocks in the
Nasdaq-100 Index, the Trustee adjusts the Securities from time to time to
conform to periodic changes in the identity and/or relative weights of Index
Securities. The composition and weighting of the securities portion of a
Portfolio Deposit are also adjusted to conform to changes in the Index. Changes
to the Index are made after the close of the market (see "The
Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit").

     The value of the Nasdaq-100 Shares will fluctuate in relation to changes in
the value of the Trust's portfolio of securities. However, at any point in time,
the market price of each individual Nasdaq-100 Share may not be identical to the
net asset value ("NAV") of such share. Historically, these two valuations have
been very close.

     The current value of the Nasdaq-100 Index will ordinarily continue to be
reported even when trading is interrupted in its component stocks. In that


                                       3
<PAGE>

event, the reported Index level will be based on the current market price of
those stocks still being traded (if any) and the last reported prices for those
stocks that are not currently trading. As a result, reported Index levels may at
times be based on noncurrent price information with respect to some or even all
of the stocks in the Index Securities.

Nasdaq-100 Shares are Listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market

     Nasdaq-100 Shares are listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Market tier
of Nasdaq. Previously (prior to December 1, 2004), Nasdaq-100 Shares were listed
for trading on the American Stock Exchange (the "Amex"). Nasdaq-100 Shares are
bought and sold in the secondary market like regular shares of stock at any time
during the trading day. Nasdaq-100 Shares generally trade in round lots of 100
shares, but can be traded in odd lots of as little as one share. Trading of
Nasdaq-100 Shares on Nasdaq may be halted under the circumstances described in
the paragraphs below relating to the risks of investing in Nasdaq-100 Shares.

The Nasdaq-100 Trust Issues and Redeems Nasdaq-100 Shares in Multiples of 50,000
Shares Called "Creation Units"

     The Trust issues Nasdaq-100 Shares only in multiples of 50,000 shares,
which are referred to as "Creation Units." Creation Units are issued by the
Trust to anyone who, after placing a creation order with ALPS Distributors, Inc.
(the "Distributor"), deposits with The Bank of New York, the "Trustee" of the
Trust, a specified portfolio of Nasdaq-100 Index securities, as well as a cash
payment, if any, generally equal to accumulated dividends of the securities (net
of expenses) up to the time of deposit.

     Nasdaq-100 Shares are not individually redeemable, except upon termination
of the Trust. Nasdaq-100 Shares can be redeemed only by tendering to the Trust
50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares or multiples thereof. Upon redemption, the redeeming
holder will receive a portfolio of Nasdaq-100 Index securities based on the net
asset value of the Trust plus, in some cases, a cash payment. The cash payment
amount is generally equal to the cash amount determined for creations of
Nasdaq-100 Shares and, likewise, may be paid by either the redeeming holder or
the Trust, depending on the values of the dividends received, Trust expenses and
the adjustment amount.


                                       4

Creation Orders Must be Placed With the Distributor

     All orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares must be placed with the Distributor
(see "The Trust--Procedures for Creation of Creation Units"). To be eligible to
place orders with the Distributor to create Creation Unit size aggregations of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, an entity or person either must be (1) a "Participating
Party," as hereinafter defined, or (2) a Depository Trust Company Participant
(see "Book-Entry Ownership Only of Nasdaq-100 Shares"), and in each case must
have executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement. The term "Participating Party"
means a broker-dealer or other participant in the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process,
through the Continuous Net Settlement ("CNS") System of the National Securities
Clearing Corporation ("NSCC"), a clearing agency that is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission").(3) Upon acceptance of an
order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Distributor will transmit such order to
the Trustee and instruct the Trustee to initiate the book-entry movement of the
appropriate number of Nasdaq-100 Shares to the account of the entity placing the
order. Payment for orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares will be made by deposits
with the Trustee of a portfolio of securities that is substantially similar in
composition and weighting to the Index Securities (see "The Trust--Creation of
Creation Units"), together, in certain cases, with a cash payment in an amount
which shall be equal to the Income Net of Expense Amount (as hereinafter
defined), plus or minus, as the case may be, the Balancing Amount (as
hereinafter defined). The "Income Net of Expense Amount" is an amount equal, on
a per Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on all the Securities with
ex-dividend dates within the period beginning on the most recent ex-dividend
date for Nasdaq-100 Shares (the third Friday in each of March, June, September,
and December, see "Distributions") through and including the current Business
Day (the "Accumulation Period") as if all of the Securities had been held for
such period, net of accrued expenses and liabilities for such period not
previously deducted (including, without limitation, (x) taxes or other
governmental charges against the Trust not previously deducted, if any, and (y)
accrued fees of the Trustee and other expenses of the Trust (including legal and
auditing expenses) and other expenses not previously deducted (see "Expenses of
the Trust")). The

-----------------------------
(3)  As of December 31, 2004, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
     Inc. (the "NASD") beneficially owned approximately 3.71% of the issued and
     outstanding shares of common stock of The Depository Trust & Clearing
     Corporation ("DTCC"), the parent company of NSCC and the Depository, and
     the NASD owned 10,000 shares of Series B preferred stock of DTCC, which
     entitles the NASD to elect one director of DTCC. The NASD currently has
     majority voting control of Nasdaq.


                                       5
<PAGE>

"Balancing Amount" serves the function of compensating for any differences
between (1) the value of the portfolio of securities deposited with the Trustee
in connection with a creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares, together with the Income Net
of Expense Amount, and (2) the net asset value of the Trust on a per Creation
Unit basis (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit" for a
further description thereof).

     The Income Net of Expense Amount and the Balancing Amount are collectively
referred to herein as the "Cash Component" and the deposit of such a portfolio
of securities and the Cash Component are collectively referred to herein as a
"Portfolio Deposit." In connection with an order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares on
any given day, the Cash Component of the Portfolio Deposit may be payable either
by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust to the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares or by
the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust,
depending upon the respective amounts of the Income Net of Expense Amount and
the Balancing Amount.

     An entity or person placing creation orders with the Distributor must
either (i) initiate instructions pertaining to Portfolio Deposits through the
CNS clearing processes of NSCC, as such processes have been enhanced to effect
creations and redemptions of Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100
Shares, such processes being referred to herein as the "Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process," or (ii) deposit Portfolio Deposits with the Trustee outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process (i.e., through the facilities of The Depository
Trust Company).

     The Distributor acts as underwriter of Nasdaq-100 Shares on an agency
basis. The Distributor maintains records of the orders placed with it and the
confirmations of acceptance and furnishes to those placing such orders
confirmations of acceptance of the orders. The Distributor also is responsible
for delivering a prospectus to persons creating Nasdaq-100 Shares. The
Distributor also maintains a record of the delivery instructions in response to
orders and may provide certain other administrative services, such as those
related to state securities law compliance. The Distributor is a corporation
organized under the laws of the State of Colorado and is located at 370 17th
Street, Suite 3100, Denver, CO 80202. The Distributor is a registered
broker-dealer and a member of the NASD. The Sponsor pays the Distributor a flat
annual fee for certain distribution services. The Sponsor will not seek
reimbursement for such payment from the Trust without obtaining prior exemptive
relief from the Commission.

Bar Chart and Table

     The bar chart below entitled "Annual Total Returns for the Trust" and table
below entitled "Average Annual Total Returns (for periods ending December 31,
2004)" provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Trust by showing
the variability of the Trust's returns based on net assets and comparing the
Trust's performance to the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index. Past performance
(both before and after tax) is not necessarily an indication of how the Trust
will perform in the future.

     The after-tax returns presented below are calculated using highest
historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the
impact of state and local taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on
your specific tax situation and may differ from those shown below. After-tax
returns are not relevant to investors who hold Nasdaq-100 Shares through
tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement
accounts.

     The total returns in the bar chart below, as well as the total and
after-tax returns presented in the Table, do not reflect Transaction Fees
payable by those persons purchasing and redeeming Creation Units, nor brokerage
commissions incurred by those persons purchasing and selling Nasdaq-100 Shares
in the secondary market (see footnotes to the Table).

     This bar chart shows the performance of the Trust for each full calendar
year since its inception on March 4, 1999. During the period shown below
(January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2004), the highest quarterly return for
the Trust was 34.88% for the quarter ended December 31, 2001, and the lowest was
-36.18% for the quarter ended September 30, 2001.

     Future expense accruals will depend primarily on the level of the Trust's
net assets and the level of expenses. There is no guarantee that in the future
the Trust's ordinary operating expenses will not exceed 0.20% of the Trust's
daily net asset value. The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue its
reimbursement policy in the future.

     A transaction fee is payable to the Trustee in connection with each
creation and redemption of Creation Units made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process ("Transaction Fee") and is nonrefundable, regardless of the NAV of the
Trust.

     Until further notice is given as described below, the Transaction Fee
charged in connection with each creation of Creation Units through the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is (i) $500 per Participating Party per day for
creations of Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares where there
are also, in the same day, separate creations in any number, or redemptions in
an amount not equal to the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares created, of other similar
exchange traded funds based on the Index for which the Trustee or its affiliate
acts as trustee, fund administrator or in any similar capacity, (ii) no fee per
Participating Party where there is, in the same day, a redemption of an equal
number of shares of another similar exchange traded fund based on the Index for
which the Trustee or its affiliate acts as the

trustee, fund administrator or in any similar capacity, and (iii) in all other
cases $1,000 per Participating Party per day, regardless of the number of
Creation Units created on such day by such Participating Party. Likewise, until
further notice is given as described below, the Transaction Fee charged in
connection with the Redemption of Creation Units through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process is (i) $500 per Participating Party per day for redemption of Creation
Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares where there are also, in the same
day, separate redemptions in any number, or creations in an amount not equal to
the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares redeemed, or another similar exchange traded
fund based on the Index for which the Trustee or its affiliate acts as trustee,
fund administrator or in any similar capacity, (ii) no fee per Participating
Party where there is, in the same day, a creation of an equal number of shares
of another similar exchange traded fund based on the Index for which the Trustee
or its affiliate acts as the trustee, fund administrator or in any similar
capacity, and (iii) in all other cases $1,000 per Participating Party per day,
regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed on such day by such
Participating Party. This Transaction Fee may subsequently be changed by the
Trustee, with the consent of the Sponsor, but will not in any event exceed
10/100 of one percent (10 basis points) of the value of a Creation Unit at the
time of creation or redemption, as the case may be (the "10 Basis Point Limit").
No modification to, or reductions, discounts or waivers of, the Transaction Fee
charged in connection with the creation of Creation Units is scheduled or
currently contemplated by the Sponsor or the Trustee.

     For creations and redemptions outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, an
additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the applicable Transaction Fee
will be charged to the creator or redeemer. Under the current schedule,
therefore, the total fee charged in connection with the creation or redemption
of Creation Units outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process would be (i) $500 per
Participating Party per day for creations of Creation Unit size aggregations of
Nasdaq-100 Shares where there are also, in the same day, separate creations in
any number, or redemptions in an amount not equal to the number of Nasdaq-100
Shares created, of other similar exchange traded funds based on the Index for
which the Trustee or its affiliate acts as trustee, fund administrator or in any
similar capacity, (ii) no fee per Participating Party where there is, in the
same day, a redemption of an equal number of shares of another similar exchange
traded fund based on the Index for which the Trustee or its affiliate acts as
the trustee, fund administrator or in any similar capacity and (iii) in all
other cases $1,000 (the Transaction Fee for the creation or redemption of a
Creation Unit) plus an additional amount not to exceed $3,000 (3 times $1,000)
for a total of $4,000.

Expenses of the Trust

     The expenses of the Trust will be accrued daily and reflected in the net
asset value of the Trust. Until the Sponsor otherwise determines, the Sponsor
has undertaken that the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust will not exceed
0.20% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust, and the Sponsor will
reimburse the Trust for expenses incurred by the Trust in excess of such amount.

    (1) In addition, secondary market purchases and sale of Nasdaq-100 Shares
        are subject to ordinary brokerage commissions and charges.

    (2) The Trustee's annual fee ranges from 0.04% to 0.10%, based on the net
        asset value of the Trust. Ordinary operating expenses of the Trust do
        not include brokerage commissions incurred on the purchase or sale of
        Securities.

    (3) Marketing expenses include direct advertising in print and television
        media, and the cost of production of such advertising, consultant fees
        and prospectus printing expenses.

    (4) The amount represents less than 0.01%.

    (5) Until the Sponsor otherwise determines, the Sponsor has undertaken
        that the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust will not be permitted
        to exceed 0.20% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust.
        Gross expenses of the Trust for the year ending September 30, 2004,
        without regard to this undertaking, were also 0.20% of the net asset
        value of the Trust and, accordingly, no expenses of the Trust were
        assumed by the Sponsor. The Sponsor may, in its sole discretion,
        discontinue its undertaking to limit ordinary operating expenses of the
        Trust. See "Expenses of the Trust."

     An investor does not pay any sales charges in connection with purchases or
reinvestment of distributions of Nasdaq-100 Shares or ordinarily any deferred
sales charge on the redemption (redemptions are only allowed in Creation Unit
sizes -- i.e., 50,000 Shares of Nasdaq-100 Shares). Investors purchasing or
selling Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market would incur customary
brokerage commissions and charges.

     Transaction fees charged in connection with each creation or redemption of
Creation Units through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process range from $0 to $1,000
per Participating Party, depending on whether they are separate creations or
redemptions of Nasdaq-100 Shares or shares of other similar exchange traded
funds based on the Index.

Example of Expenses:

     An investor would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment,
assuming the estimated operating expense ratio cap of 0.20% set forth in
footnote (5) above for the year ending September 30, 2004, and assuming
estimated gross operating expenses thereafter remain at 0.20% of the net asset
value of the Trust and a 5% annual return on investment throughout the periods.

     Cumulative Expenses Paid for Period of:

     The above example assumes the reinvestment of all dividends and
distributions and utilizes a 5% annual rate of return as mandated by Commission
regulations applicable to mutual funds. Although the Trust is a unit investment
trust rather than a mutual fund, this information is represented to permit a
comparison of fees. The example should not be considered a representation of
past or future expenses or annual rate of return; the actual expenses and annual
rate of return may be more or less than those assumed for purposes of this
example. Investors should also note that the presentation of a $1,000 investment
is for illustration purposes only. Pursuant to an exemptive order obtained from
the Commission, the Trust may reimburse the Sponsor for certain expenses
relating to the printing and distribution of marketing materials describing the
Nasdaq-100 Shares and the Trust, reimbursement to the Sponsor for annual
licensing fees and federal and state annual registration fees for the issuance
of Nasdaq-100 Shares up to 0.20% (20 basis points) of the Trust's total assets.

Book-Entry Ownership Only of Nasdaq-100 Shares

     The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, a limited purpose trust
company organized under the laws of the State of New York (referred to herein as
"DTC") or its nominee will be the record or registered owner of all


                                       11
<PAGE>

outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares. Beneficial ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares will be
shown on the records of the DTC or its participants. Certificates will not be
issued for Nasdaq-100 Shares, whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or
otherwise.

Distributions

     Distributions by the Trust are made quarterly to the extent that dividends
accumulated in respect of the Securities and other income, if any, received by
the Trust exceed Trust fees and expenses accrued during the quarterly
Accumulation Period which ends on the Business Day preceding each ex-dividend
date for Nasdaq-100 Shares. However, no net dividend distribution will be made
in any given quarter, and any net dividend amounts will be rolled into the next
Accumulation Period, if the aggregate net dividend distribution would be in an
amount less than 5/100 of one percent (0.05%) of the net asset value of the
Trust, unless the Trustee determines that such distribution is required to be
made in order to maintain the Trust's status as a regulated investment company
or to avoid the imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income.

     The expenses of the Trust may be as great as or in excess of the dividend
and other income to be received by the Trust during any quarter and, under such
circumstances, no quarterly net dividend distributions would be made.

     Any net capital gains recognized by the Trust in any taxable year are to be
distributed at least annually. The Trust may make additional distributions after
the end of the year in order to satisfy certain distribution requirements
imposed by the Code (as defined below). Although income distributions, if any,
are currently made on a quarterly basis, the Trustee reserves the right to vary
the frequency of distributions.

Federal Income Tax Considerations

     The Trust has elected tax treatment as a "regulated investment company"
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), and
distributes annually its entire investment company taxable income and capital
gain, if any. Distributions that are taxable as ordinary income to Beneficial
Owners generally are expected to constitute dividend income for federal income
tax purposes and to be eligible for the dividends-received deduction available
to many corporations to the extent of qualifying dividend income received by the
Trust. The quarterly distributions, if any, made by the Trust will be based on
the dividend performance of the Securities held during such quarterly
distribution period, net of Trust fees and expenses, rather than the actual
taxable income of the Trust. As a result, a portion of any such distributions of
the Trust may be treated as a return of capital or a capital gain dividend for
federal income tax purposes or the Trust may be required to make additional
distributions to


                                       12
<PAGE>

maintain its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of
income or excise taxes on undistributed income.

Termination of the Nasdaq-100 Trust

     The Trust has a specified lifetime term. The Trust will terminate by its
terms on the first to occur of: (i) March 4, 2124 or (ii) the date twenty (20)
years after the death of the last survivor of fifteen persons named in the Trust
Agreement, the oldest of whom was born in 1986 and the youngest of whom was born
in 1996 (the "Mandatory Termination Date").

Purchases of Nasdaq-100 Shares by Registered Investment Companies

     Purchases of Nasdaq-100 Shares by registered investment companies are
subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. On
April 9, 2004, the Commission has issued an order that would permit registered
investment companies to invest in Nasdaq-100 Shares beyond these limits, subject
to certain conditions and terms stated in the application. One such condition
stated in the application is that registered investment companies relying on the
order must enter into a written agreement with the Trust.

Risk Factors

     Investors can lose money by investing in Nasdaq-100 Shares. Investors
should carefully consider the risk factors described below together with all of
the other information included in this Prospectus before deciding to invest in
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     Investment in the Trust involves the risk that the value of the Securities
may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the
issuers of the Securities, the value of common stocks generally, and other
factors. The composition and weighting of the Index Securities and hence the
composition and weighting of the Securities held in the Trust also change from
time to time.

     The financial condition of the issuers of the Securities may become
impaired or the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate (either of
which may cause a decrease in the value of the Securities and thus in the value
of Nasdaq-100 Shares). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market
fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market
confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor
perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including
expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies,
inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or
regional political, economic, and banking crises. There can be no assurance that
the issuers of the Securities will pay dividends on outstanding shares of


                                       13
<PAGE>

common stock. Distributions on the Securities will generally depend upon the
declaration of dividends by the issuers of the Securities; the declaration of
such dividends generally depends upon various factors, including the financial
condition of the issuers and general economic conditions.

     The Trust is not actively managed by traditional methods, and therefore the
adverse financial condition of an issuer will not result in the elimination of
its securities from the Securities held by the Trust unless the Securities of
such issuer are removed from the Index.

     Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders
of preferred stocks and debt obligations of such issuer because common
stockholders, as owners of such issuer, have generally subordinate rights to
receive payments from such issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors of,
or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer.
Further, unlike debt securities which typically have a stated principal amount
payable at maturity (whose value, however, will be subject to market
fluctuations prior thereto), or preferred stocks which typically have a
liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory
redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a
maturity. Common stock values are subject to market fluctuations as long as the
common stock remains outstanding. The value of the Securities may therefore be
expected to fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust.

     All of the Securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq National Market.
The existence of a liquid trading market for certain Securities may depend on
whether dealers will make a market in such Securities. There can be no assurance
that a market will be made for any of the Securities, that any market for the
Securities will be maintained, or that any such market will be or remain liquid.
The price at which the Securities may be sold and the value of the Trust will be
adversely affected if trading markets for the Securities are limited or absent.

     An investment in the Trust should also be made with an understanding that
the Trust will not be able to replicate exactly the performance of the Index
because the total return generated by the Securities will be reduced by
transaction costs incurred in adjusting the actual balance of the Securities and
other Trust expenses, whereas such transaction costs and expenses are not
included in the calculation of the Index. It is also possible that for short
periods of time, the Trust may not fully replicate the performance of the Index
due to the temporary unavailability of certain Index Securities in the secondary
market or due to other extraordinary circumstances. Such events are unlikely to
continue for an extended period of time because the Trustee is required to
correct such imbalances by means of adjusting the composition of the Securities.
It is also possible that the composition of the Trust may not


                                       14
<PAGE>

exactly replicate the composition of the Index if the Trust has to adjust its
portfolio holdings in order to continue to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under the Code.

     The time frames for delivery of Securities, cash, or Nasdaq-100 Shares in
connection with creation and redemption activity within the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process as set forth herein are based on NSCC's current "regular way" settlement
period of three (3) days during which NSCC is open for business (each such day
an "NSCC Business Day"). NSCC may, in the future, reduce such "regular way"
settlement period, in which case it is anticipated that there would be a
corresponding reduction or increase in settlement periods applicable to
Nasdaq-100 Share creations and redemptions.

     Distribution to Beneficial Owners is dependent on the payment of dividends
by issuers of the Securities.

     The Sponsor has currently undertaken to limit ordinary operating expenses
of the Trust to 0.20%. The Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, discontinue its
undertaking to limit ordinary operating expenses of the Trust. In such event,
expenses of the Trust could exceed the dividend and other income received by the
Trust during each quarter. The Trust will pay any such excess expenses with the
proceeds realized from the sale of Securities effected ordinarily whenever the
Trustee determines that projected annualized fees and expenses accrued on a
daily basis exceed projected annualized dividends and the Trust income accrued
on a daily basis by more than 1/100 of one percent (0.01%) of the net asset
value of the Trust.

     The net asset value of the Nasdaq-100 Shares may not always correspond to
market price. The net asset value of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size
aggregations and, proportionately, the net asset value per Nasdaq-100 Share
changes as fluctuations occur in the market value of the Securities. Investors
should also be aware that the aggregate public trading market price of 50,000
Nasdaq-100 Shares may be different from the net asset value of a Creation Unit
size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares (i.e., 50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares may trade
at a premium over or at a discount to the net asset value of a Creation Unit)
and similarly the public trading market price per Nasdaq-100 Share may be
different from the net asset value of a Creation Unit on a per Nasdaq-100 Share
basis. This price difference may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply
and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for Nasdaq-100 Shares
will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing
the prices of the Index component securities trading individually or in the
aggregate at any point in time. The expenses of the Trust, which are accrued
daily, are reflected in the net asset value of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation
Unit size aggregations.


                                       15
<PAGE>

     Trading in Nasdaq-100 Shares on Nasdaq may be halted due to market
conditions or, in light of Nasdaq rules and procedures for reasons that, in the
view of Nasdaq, make trading in Nasdaq-100 Shares inadvisable. There can be no
assurance that the requirements of Nasdaq necessary to maintain the listing of
Nasdaq-100 Shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged. The Trust
will be terminated in the event Nasdaq-100 Shares are delisted from Nasdaq and
are not subsequently relisted on a national securities exchange or a quotation
medium operated by a national securities association.

     Nasdaq-100 Shares are subject to the risk of an investment in a portfolio
of equity securities in economic sectors in which the Index may be highly
concentrated (e.g., technology) as well as to the risks specific to the
performance of a few individual component Securities which currently represent a
highly concentrated weighting in the Index. These include the risks that the
level of stock prices in these sectors or the stock prices of these specific
companies may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of Nasdaq-100
Shares. In addition, because it is the policy of the Trust to invest in the
securities that comprise the Index, if the Index is concentrated in an industry
or group of industries, the portfolio of Securities also will be concentrated in
that industry or group of industries. Furthermore, investors should be aware
that in the event that one or more stocks which currently have a highly
concentrated weighting in the Index were to leave The Nasdaq Stock Market, if a
company with a large market capitalization were to list its shares on The Nasdaq
Stock Market, or if there were a significant rebalancing of the Index, then the
composition and weighting of the Index, and hence the composition and weighting
of the Securities in the Trust, would change significantly and the performance
of Nasdaq-100 Shares would reflect the performance of the new Index as
reconfigured.

     Furthermore, due to the concentration of the Index in sectors characterized
by relatively higher volatility in price performance when compared to other
economic sectors, the performance of the Index may be more volatile when
compared to other broad-based stock indices. It is anticipated that the price
volatility of Nasdaq-100 Shares may be greater than the price volatility of
other market-traded securities which are issued by investment companies based
upon indices other than the Index.

     Nasdaq-100 Shares are also subject to risks other than those associated
with an investment in a broad market portfolio of equity securities in that the
selection of the securities included in the Trust's portfolio, the expenses
associated with the Trust, or other factors distinguishing an ownership interest
in a trust from the direct ownership of a portfolio of securities may affect
trading the Nasdaq-100 Shares as compared with trading in a broad market
portfolio of equity securities.


                                       16

     The Trustee will ordinarily deliver a portfolio of Securities for each
Creation Unit size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares delivered for redemption,
substantially identical in composition to the Securities portion of a Portfolio
Deposit as in effect on the date a request for redemption is deemed received by
the Trustee. If a redemption is processed through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, to the extent that the Securities to be delivered on settlement date
are not delivered, they will be covered by NSCC's guarantee of the completion of
such delivery. Any Securities not received on settlement date will be marked to
the market on a daily basis until delivery is completed. The Trust, to the
extent it has not already done so, remains obligated to deliver such Securities
to NSCC, and the market risk of any increase in the value of such Securities
until delivery is made by the Trust to NSCC could adversely affect the net asset
value of the Trust. Investors should note that the Securities to be delivered to
a redeemer submitting a redemption request outside of the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process that are not delivered to such redeemer are not covered by NSCC's
guarantee of completion of such delivery.

     The Sponsor of the Trust has been granted a license to use the Nasdaq-100
Index as a basis for determining the composition of the Trust and to use certain
trade names and trademarks of Nasdaq. The Trust may be terminated if the license
agreement is terminated.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
                        AND AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Sponsor, Trustee and the Unitholders of the Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1:

     We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of the
Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust"), including the schedule of investments,
as of September 30, 2004, and the related statements of operations and changes
in net assets for each of the three years in the period then ended, and the
financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2004,
by correspondence with the Trust's custodian and brokers. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements and the financial highlights
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 at September 30, 2004, the results of
its operations and changes in its net assets for each of the three years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1
Notes to Financial Statements
September 30, 2004
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Organization

     Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created
under the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the
opportunity to purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing
proportionate undivided interests in the portfolio of securities held by the
Trust, which consists of substantially all of the securities, in substantially
the same weighting, as the component securities of the Nasdaq-100 Index.

     The Trust commenced operations on March 5, 1999 upon the initial issuance
of 150,000 shares of the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock (equivalent to three
Creation Units) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect
the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

     Nasdaq Global Funds, Inc. (formerly Nasdaq Financial Product Services,
Inc.) is the Sponsor of the Trust and The Bank of New York is the Trustee.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant
accounting policies followed by the Trust.

Security Valuation

     Portfolio securities are valued at the Nasdaq official closing price of The
Nasdaq Stock Market, which is deemed to be the principal market on which the
securities are traded. If there is no Nasdaq official closing price on the day
of valuation, a security is valued at the closing bid price of The Nasdaq Stock
Market. If a security is not quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market, or the principal
market of the security is other than The Nasdaq Stock Market, or the Trustee
deems the official close price or closing bid price inappropriate for valuation
purposes, then the security shall be fair valued by the Trustee in good faith
based (a) on the closing price for the security on another market on which the
security is traded or if there is no such appropriate closing price, at the
closing bid price on such other market, (b) on current bid prices on The Nasdaq
Stock Market or such other markets, (c) if bid prices are not available, on the
basis of


                                       23
<PAGE>

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

current bid prices for comparable securities, (d) by the Trustee's appraising
the value of the securities in good faith on the bid side of the market, or (e)
any combination thereof.

Investment Transactions

     Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on a specific
identification basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

Distributions to Unitholders

     The Trust will declare and distribute dividends, if any, from net
investment income quarterly. The Trust will declare and distribute net realized
capital gains, if any, at least annually.

Federal Income Tax

     The Trust has qualified and intends to continue to qualify for and elect
treatment as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By so qualifying the Trust will not be subject
to federal income taxes to the extent it distributes 90% of its net investment
income, including any net realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In
addition, by distributing during each calendar year at least 98% of its net
investment income and capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to
federal excise tax. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. To the extent these differences are permanent,
such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal
tax basis treatment; temporary differences do not require such reclassification.

     At September 30, 2004, permanent differences primarily due to the tax
treatment of in-kind transactions and interest earned on redemptions were
reclassified within the capital accounts of the Trust. These differences
resulted in a net decrease of $5,217,121 in undistributed net investment income,
a net increase in accumulated net realized loss of $2,024,647,203 on investments
and a corresponding increase to paid in surplus of $2,029,864,324. This
reclassification had no effect on net assets of the Trust.

     The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30,
2004 was $8,613,794 of ordinary income.

     At September 30, 2004, the Trust had a capital loss carryforward of
$11,845,518,450, of which $18,036,354 expires in 2007, $9,472,938 expires in
2008, $615,423,028 expires in 2009, $2,457,820,737 expires in 2010,
$5,729,023,648 expires in 2011 and $3,015,741,745 expires in 2012.


                                       24
<PAGE>

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

     Capital losses incurred after October 31 ("post-October" losses) within the
taxable year are deemed to arise on the first business day of the Trust's next
taxable year. The Trust incurred and will elect to defer net capital losses of
$1,687,659,837 for the year ended September 30, 2004. These carryover losses may
be used to offset future gains. To the extent they are so used, future gains

3. Transactions with the Trustee and Sponsor

     The Trust pays the expenses of its operations, including the fees of its
Trustee and reimbursement to the Sponsor for expenses of the Sponsor relating to
the marketing of the Trust and for payments to The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.
(the "Licensor") for a license to use the Nasdaq-100 Index as a basis for
determining the composition and weighting of securities held by the Trust. The
annual license fee to the Licensor is 4/100 of one percent (0.04%) of the
average net assets of the Trust. License fees of $2,123,160 were payable to the
Licensor at September 30, 2004. Currently, the License Agreement is scheduled to
expire on March 10, 2009 in accordance with its terms.

     In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee maintains the Trust's
accounting records, acts as custodian and transfer agent to the Trust, and
provides administrative services, including filing of all required regulatory
reports. The Trustee is also responsible for determining the composition of the
portfolio of securities, which must be delivered in exchange for the issuance of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of the Nasdaq-100 Index. For these services, the Trustee
receives a fee at the following annual rates:

3. Transactions with the Trustee and Sponsor (continued)

*    The fee indicated applies to that portion of the net asset value of the
     Trust which falls in the size category indicated and is computed each
     business day on the basis of net asset value of the Trust on such day.

     The minimum annual fee, which shall be paid to the Trustee, is $180,000. To
the extent that the amount of the Trustee's compensation is less than such
minimum annual fee, the Sponsor has agreed to pay the amount of such shortfall.

     Until the Sponsor otherwise determines, the ordinary operating expenses of
the Trust as calculated by the Trustee would not be permitted to exceed an
amount which is 20/100 of one percent (0.20%) per annum of the daily net assets
of the Trust. To the extent during such periods that ordinary operating expenses
of the Trust exceeded such amounts, the Sponsor reimbursed the Trust or assumed
invoices on behalf of the Trust for such excess ordinary operating expenses.

     The Sponsor retains the ability to be repaid by the Trust for expenses so
reimbursed or assumed to the extent that subsequently during the fiscal year
expenses fall below the applicable per annum level on any given day. For the
years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, ordinary operating expenses incurred by
the Trust did not exceed the 0.20% per annum level and, accordingly, no expenses
of the Trust were assumed by the Sponsor. During 2002, the Trust was refunded
previously paid 2001 Commission filing fees of $4,109,251, which permitted the
Sponsor to be reimbursed in 2002 for expenses previously assumed in 2001. The
reimbursement resulted in a reduction of expenses assumed by the Sponsor of
$148,486 for the year ended September 30, 2002.

     In addition, $4,062,514 of marketing expenses paid by the Sponsor on behalf
of the Trust for invoices received directly by the Sponsor during the year
remain payable to the Sponsor at September 30, 2004.

     ALPS Distributors, Inc. (the "Distributor") is the distributor for the
Trust. The Sponsor, not the Trust, pays the Distributor a flat annual fee for
its distribution services.

</TABLE>

     Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock shares are issued and redeemed by the Trust
only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000 Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking
Stock shares. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment that is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking share and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per share of the Trust on the
transaction date. The transaction fee charged in connection with creation or
redemption of Creation Units through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is either
$0, $500, or $1,000 per participating party per day, depending on specific
circumstances. The total fee charged in connection with the creation or
redemption of Creation Units outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is $4,000
per participating party per day.

     Transaction fees are received by the Trustee from the Participating Party,
as defined, and used to offset the expense of processing orders. For the years
ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Trustee earned $428,000, $361,000
and $377,000, respectively, in transaction fees. The Trustee, in its sole
discretion, may voluntarily reduce or waive its fee, or modify its transaction
fee schedule, subject to certain limitations. There were no such reductions or
waivers for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

5. Investment Transactions

     For the year ended September 30, 2004, the Trust had purchases and sales of
investment securities of $1,461,819,956 and $1,459,908,686, respectively. This
excludes securities received or delivered from processing creations or
redemptions of the Trust. At September 30, 2004, the cost of investments for
federal income tax purposes was $32,706,909,159. Accordingly, gross unrealized
depreciation was $13,173,318,849 and gross unrealized appreciation was
$842,624,642 resulting in net unrealized depreciation of $12,330,694,207.

6. Reclassification

     In 2003, certain 2002 amounts were reclassified to conform to the 2003
presentation. Accordingly, net realized loss on sale of investments and net
change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments included in the
statements of operations and changes in net assets for the year ended September
30, 2002 were decreased and increased by $529,718,413, respectively. This prior
year reclassification had no impact on the 2002 net assets or the net increase
(decrease) in net assets resulting from operations.

7. Subsequent Events (Unaudited)

     On December 2, 2004, Microsoft Corporation paid a special dividend of $3.00
per share to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004, which resulted in
dividend income of $204,265,356 to the Trust in fiscal 2005. Also, in December
2004, the Trust paid an ordinary income dividend to shareholders of $.37858 per
share or $213,935,811 in aggregate, in part as a result of the Microsoft
Corporation special dividend.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Investors in the Trust should be aware that the Sponsor of the Trust is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Nasdaq. Nasdaq is the proprietor of the Index as well
as the operator of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the marketplace where the Index
Securities are listed. The NASD maintains majority voting control of Nasdaq.

     Under the terms of a license agreement with Nasdaq, the Sponsor has been
granted a license to use the Index as a basis for determining the composition of
the Trust and to use certain service marks and trademarks of Nasdaq in
connection with the Trust (see "License Agreement"). Under the terms of the
license agreement, the Sponsor pays to Nasdaq an annual licensing fee for use of
the Index. The Sponsor ordinarily will seek reimbursement from the Trust for the
amount of licensing fees (see "Expenses of the Trust").

     The Index is determined, composed, and calculated by Nasdaq without regard
to the Sponsor, the Trust, or the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Nasdaq
has complete control and sole discretion in determining, composing, or
calculating the Index or in modifying in any way its method for determining,
composing, or calculating the Index in the future.

                                    THE TRUST

     The Trust, an exchange traded fund or "ETF," is a registered investment
company which both (a) continuously issues and redeems "in-kind" its shares,
known as Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock or QQQ(SM), only in large lot sizes
called Creation Units at their once-daily NAV and (b) lists the shares
individually for trading on Nasdaq at prices established throughout the trading
day, like any other listed equity security trading in the secondary market on
Nasdaq. The Securities held by the Trust consist of a portfolio of equity
securities or, in the case of securities not yet delivered in connection with
purchases made by the Trust or Portfolio Deposits, confirmations of contracts to
purchase such securities (collectively, the "Portfolio").

Creation of Creation Units

     Portfolio Deposits may be deposited with the Trustee via instructions
submitted through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process of NSCC, following placement
with the Distributor of orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares by a person who has
executed a Participant Agreement with the Distributor and the Trustee. The
Distributor shall reject any order that is not submitted in proper form.
Investors may deposit Portfolio Deposits through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process
or directly with the Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. The
Transaction Fee will be charged at the time of creation of a Creation Unit size
aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares. An additional amount


                                       33
<PAGE>

not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for a Creation Unit
will be charged to a creator creating outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process
(i.e., depositing Portfolio Deposits directly with the Trustee through DTC), in
part due to the increased expense associated with settlement outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process.

     The Trustee and the Sponsor, from time to time and for such periods as they
may determine, together may increase(4) or reduce the amount and/or waive the
imposition altogether of the Transaction Fee (and/or the additional amounts
charged in connection with creations and/or redemptions outside the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process) for certain numbers of Creation Units of Nasdaq-100 Shares
created or redeemed, whether applied solely to creations and/or redemptions made
through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, solely to creations and/or redemptions
made outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, or to both methods of creation
and/or redemption. The Sponsor also reserves the right, from time to time, to
vary the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares per Creation Unit (currently 50,000 shares)
and such change may or may not be made in conjunction with a change to the
Transaction Fee. The occurrence of any increase, reduction, or waiver of the
Transaction Fee and the number of Creation Units created or redeemed to which
such increase, reduction, or waiver applies shall be disclosed in the then
current Nasdaq-100 Share Prospectus.

     The Sponsor makes available on each Business Day a list of the names and
the required number of shares for each of the securities in the current
Portfolio Deposit as well as the Income Net of Expense Amount effective through
and including the previous Business Day per outstanding Nasdaq-100 Share. The
Sponsor may choose within its discretion to make available, frequently
throughout each Business Day, a number representing, on a per Nasdaq-100 Share
basis, the sum of the Income Net of Expense Amount effective through and
including the previous Business Day plus the current value of the securities
portion of a Portfolio Deposit as in effect on such day (which value will
occasionally include a cash-in-lieu amount to compensate for the omission of a
particular Index Security from such Portfolio Deposit, see "The
Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit"). The Nasdaq Stock Market
calculates the Nasdaq-100 Index intra-day every 15 seconds on every business day
in which The Nasdaq Stock Market is open for trading. If the Sponsor elects to
make such information available, it would be calculated

-----------------------
(4)  Such increase is subject to the 10 Basis Point Limit discussed above under
     "Highlights--Average Annual Total Returns." Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares
     or of the additional amounts charged in connection with the creation or
     redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is
     beyond that which is discussed herein under the caption
     "Highlights--Average Annual Total Returns."


                                       34
<PAGE>

based upon the best information available to the Sponsor and may be calculated
by other persons designated to do so by the Sponsor. If the Sponsor elects to
make such information available, the inability of the Sponsor or its designee to
provide such information for any period of time will not in itself result in a
halt in the trading of Nasdaq-100 Shares on Nasdaq. If such information is made
available, investors interested in creating Nasdaq-100 Shares or purchasing
Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market should not rely solely on such
information in making investment decisions but should also consider other market
information and relevant economic and other factors (including, without
limitation, information regarding the Index, the Index Securities, and financial
instruments based on the Index).

     Upon receipt of one or more Portfolio Deposits following placement with the
Distributor of an order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Trustee will register
the ownership of the Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations in the
name of the DTC or its nominee. In turn, the Nasdaq-100 Share position will be
removed from the Trustee's account at the DTC and will be allocated to the
account of the DTC Participant acting on behalf of the depositor creating
Creation Unit(s). Each Nasdaq-100 Share represents a fractional undivided
interest in the Trust in an amount equal to one (1) divided by the total number
of Nasdaq-100 Shares outstanding. The Trustee may reject a request to create
Creation Units made by any depositor or group of depositors if such
depositor(s), upon the acceptance by the Trustee of such request and the
issuance to such depositor(s) of Nasdaq-100 Shares, would own eighty percent
(80%) or more of the outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Trustee also may reject
any Portfolio Deposit or any component thereof under certain other
circumstances. In the event there is a failure to deliver the Index Securities
which are the subject of such contracts to purchase or the Cash Component
includes cash in lieu of the delivery of one or more Index Securities, the
Trustee will be instructed pursuant to the Trust Agreement to acquire such Index
Securities in an expeditious manner. Hence, price fluctuations during the period
from the time the cash is received by the Trustee to the time the requisite
Index Securities are purchased and delivered will affect the value of all
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

Procedures for Creation of Creation Units

     All orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares must be placed in multiples of
50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares (Creation Unit size). All orders to create Nasdaq-100
Shares, whether through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process or outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, must be received by the Distributor by no later
than the closing time of the regular trading session on The Nasdaq Stock Market
("Closing Time") (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) in each case on the date
such order is placed in order for creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares to be effected
based on the net asset value of the Trust as determined on such date.


                                       35
<PAGE>

Orders must be transmitted by telephone or other transmission method acceptable
to the Distributor and Trustee, pursuant to procedures set forth in the
Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement, as described in this prospectus. Severe
economic or market changes or disruptions, or telephone or other communication
failure, may impede the ability to reach the Trustee, the Distributor, a
Participating Party, or a DTC Participant. Nasdaq-100 Shares may also be created
in advance of the receipt by the Trustee of all or a portion of the securities
portion of the Portfolio Deposit relating to such Nasdaq-100 Shares, but only
through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. In such cases, the Participating Party
intending to utilize this procedure will be required to post collateral with the
Trustee outside of NSCC consisting of cash at least equal to 115% of the closing
value, on the day the order is deemed received, of the portion of the Portfolio
Deposit not expected to be available in the account of the Participating Party
for delivery to the Trust on the third NSCC Business Day following placement of
such order, as such amount is marked-to-the-market daily by the Trustee only for
increases in such value. This cash collateral will be required to be posted with
the Trustee by 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the morning of the NSCC Business Day
following the day such order is deemed received by the Distributor, or else the
order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares will be canceled. The Trustee will hold such
collateral in an account separate and apart from the Trust. Under NSCC rules, by
midnight of the day following the receipt by NSCC of such order, NSCC will
normally guarantee to the Trustee the delivery of the securities portion of the
Portfolio Deposit on the third NSCC Business Day following receipt of such order
or on a later date. Provided that the NSCC guarantee is established, the Trustee
will issue the Nasdaq-100 Shares (in Creation Unit size aggregations) so ordered
on such third NSCC Business Day, relying on the NSCC guarantee to make good on
the delivery of the Portfolio Deposit. In the event that the required securities
are not delivered on such third NSCC Business Day, the Trustee will take steps
to "buy-in" the missing portion of the Portfolio Deposit in accordance with NSCC
rules. The 115% cash collateral received from the creator will be returned net
of commissions and other buy-in expenses incurred by the Trustee, if any,
promptly upon settlement of delivery of all of the securities portion of the
Portfolio Deposit, or buy-in of all missing securities, or cancellation of the
order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares. Information concerning the procedures for
such cash collateralization is available from the Distributor.

     All questions as to the number of shares of each of the Index Securities,
the amount and identity of the payor of the Cash Component (i.e., the Trustee on
behalf of the Trust or the Nasdaq-100 Share creator), and the validity, form,
eligibility (including time of receipt), and acceptance for deposit of any Index
Securities to be delivered shall be determined by the Trustee, whose
determination shall be final and binding. The Trustee reserves the absolute


                                       36
<PAGE>

right to reject a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor in respect
of any Portfolio Deposit or any component thereof if (a) the depositor or group
of depositors, upon obtaining the Nasdaq-100 Shares ordered, would own 80% or
more of the current outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares; (b) the Portfolio Deposit is
not in proper form; (c) acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would have certain
adverse tax consequences (see "Tax Status of the Trust"); (d) the acceptance of
the Portfolio Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the
acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would otherwise, in the discretion of the
Trustee, have an adverse effect on the Trust or the rights of Beneficial Owners;
or (f) in the event that circumstances outside the control of the Trustee make
it for all practical purposes impossible to process creations of Nasdaq-100
Shares. The Trustee and the Sponsor shall not incur any liability in connection
with any notification of defects or irregularities in the delivery of Portfolio
Deposits or any component thereof or in connection with the rejection of a
creation order.

Placement of Creation Orders Using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process

     Portfolio Deposits created through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process must be
delivered through a Participating Party that has executed a participant
agreement with the Distributor and with the Trustee (as the same may be from
time to time amended in accordance with its terms, the "Nasdaq-100 Participant
Agreement"). The Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement authorizes the Trustee to
transmit to NSCC on behalf of the Participating Party such trade instructions as
are necessary to effect the Participating Party's creation order. Pursuant to
such trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the Participating Party agrees
to transfer the requisite Index Securities (or contracts to purchase such Index
Securities that are expected to be delivered in a "regular way" manner through
NSCC by the third (3rd) NSCC Business Day) and the Cash Component (if required)
to the Trustee, together with such additional information as may be required by
the Trustee.

Placement of Creation Orders Outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process

     Portfolio Deposits created outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process must be
delivered through a DTC Participant that has executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant
Agreement with the Distributor and with the Trustee and has stated in its order
that it is not using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process and that creation will
instead be effected through a transfer of stocks and cash. The requisite number
of Index Securities must be delivered through DTC to the account of the Trustee
by no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern time of the next Business Day immediately
following the Transmittal Date. The Trustee, through the Federal Reserve Bank
wire system, must receive the Cash Component no later than 1:00 p.m. Eastern
time on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date. If the
Trustee does not receive


                                       37
<PAGE>

both the requisite Index Securities and the Cash Component (if required) in a
timely fashion on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal
Date, such order will be canceled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such
canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Portfolio
Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the current net asset value of the
Trust. The delivery of Nasdaq-100 Shares so created will occur no later than the
third (3rd) Business Day following the day on which the creation order is deemed
received by the Distributor.

Securities Depository; Book-Entry-Only System

     The DTC acts as securities depository for Nasdaq-100 Shares. Cede & Co., as
nominee for the DTC, is registered as the record owner of all Nasdaq-100 Shares
on the books of the Trustee. Certificates will not be issued for Nasdaq-100
Shares.

     The DTC has advised the Sponsor and the Trustee as follows: the DTC is a
limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York,
a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing corporation" within the
meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a "clearing agency"
registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. The DTC was created to hold securities of its
participants (the "DTC Participants") and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions among the DTC Participants in such
securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the DTC
Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations, some of
whom (and/or their representatives) own DTCC, the parent company of the DTC and
NSCC. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as banks,
brokers, dealers, and trust companies that maintain a custodial relationship
with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (the "Indirect
Participants").

     Upon the settlement date of any creation, transfer, or redemption of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, the DTC will credit or debit, on its book-entry registration
and transfer system, the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares so created, transferred, or
redeemed to the accounts of the appropriate DTC Participants. The accounts to be
credited and charged shall be designated by the Trustee to NSCC, in the case of
a creation or redemption through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, or by the
Trustee and the DTC Participant, in the case of a creation or redemption
transacted outside of the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. Beneficial ownership of
Nasdaq-100 Shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants, and
persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants.
Ownership of beneficial interests in Nasdaq-100 Shares (owners of such
beneficial interests are referred to herein as "Beneficial Owners") will be
shown


                                       38
<PAGE>

on, and the transfer of ownership will be effected only through, records
maintained by the DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of
DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners
that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners are expected to receive from
or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase
of Nasdaq-100 Shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive
form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire
beneficial interests in Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     So long as Cede & Co., as nominee of the DTC, is the registered owner of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, references herein to the registered or record owners of
Nasdaq-100 Shares shall mean Cede & Co. and shall not mean the Beneficial Owners
of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares will not be
entitled to have Nasdaq-100 Shares registered in their names, will not receive
or be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificates in definitive form,
and will not be considered the record or registered holder thereof under the
Trust Agreement. Accordingly, each Beneficial Owner must rely on the procedures
of the DTC, the DTC Participant, and any Indirect Participant through which such
Beneficial Owner holds its interests, to exercise any rights of a holder of
Nasdaq-100 Shares under the Trust Agreement.

     The Trustee recognizes the DTC or its nominee as the owner of all
Nasdaq-100 Shares for all purposes except as expressly set forth in the Trust
Agreement. Pursuant to the agreement between the Trustee and DTC (the
"Depository Agreement"), the DTC is required to make available to the Trustee
upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the
Nasdaq-100 Share holdings of each DTC Participant. The Trustee shall inquire of
each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding
Nasdaq-100 Shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The
Trustee shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice,
statement, or other communication, in such form, number, and at such place as
such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice,
statement, or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly
or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trustee on behalf of
the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as
reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to
applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.

     Nasdaq-100 Share distributions shall be made to the DTC or its nominee,
Cede & Co. Upon receipt of any payment of distributions in respect of the
Nasdaq-100 Shares, the DTC or Cede & Co. is required immediately to credit DTC
Participants' accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their
respective beneficial interests in the Nasdaq-100 Shares, as shown on the
records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect


                                       39
<PAGE>

Participants and Beneficial Owners of the Nasdaq-100 Shares held through such
DTC Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary
practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers
in bearer form or registered in a "street name," and will be the responsibility
of such DTC Participants. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor has or will have
any responsibility or liability for any aspects of the records relating to or
notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial
ownership interests in the Nasdaq-100 Shares, or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any
other aspect of the relationship between the DTC and the DTC Participants or the
relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and
Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants.

     The DTC may determine to discontinue providing its service with respect to
Nasdaq-100 Shares at any time by giving notice to the Trustee and the Sponsor
and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law.
Under such circumstances, the Trustee and the Sponsor shall take action either
to find a replacement for the DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost
or, if such a replacement is unavailable, to terminate the Trust (see
"Administration of the Trust--Termination").

                        REDEMPTION OF NASDAQ-100 SHARES

     The Nasdaq-100 Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units. Creation Units
are redeemable in kind only and are not redeemable for cash except as described
under "Summary--Highlights--Termination of the Nasdaq-100 Trust."

Procedure for Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares

     Requests for redemptions of Creation Units may be made on any Business Day
through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process to the Trustee at its trust office at 2
Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11217, or at such other office as may be
designated by the Trustee. Requests for redemptions of Creation Units may also
be made directly to the Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process.
Requests for redemptions shall not be made to the Distributor. In the case of
redemptions made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, the Transaction Fee
will be deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer or added to the
amount owed by the redeemer to the Trustee, as applicable. In case of
redemptions tendered directly to the Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, a total fee will be charged equal to the Transaction Fee plus an
additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable
for a Creation Unit (due in part to the increased expense associated with
delivery outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process), and such amount will be
deducted from the amount delivered to the


                                       40
<PAGE>

redeemer or added to the amount owed by the redeemer to the Trustee on behalf of
the Trust, as applicable (see "Summary"). In all cases, the tender of Nasdaq-100
Shares for redemption and distributions to the redeemer (or payments to the
Trustee, as applicable) in respect of Nasdaq-100 Shares redeemed will be
effected through DTC and the relevant DTC Participant(s) to the Beneficial Owner
thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the relevant DTC
Participant, as the case may be (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").

     The Trustee will transfer to the redeeming Beneficial Owner via DTC and the
relevant DTC Participant(s) a portfolio of Securities for each Creation Unit
size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares delivered, generally identical in
composition and weighting to the securities portion of a Portfolio Deposit as in
effect (1) on the date a request for redemption is deemed received by the
Trustee as described below, in the case of redemptions made either through the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process or outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process or (2) on
the date that notice of the termination of the Trust is given. The Trustee also
transfers via the relevant DTC Participant(s) to the redeeming Beneficial Owner
a "Cash Redemption Payment," which on any given Business Day is an amount
identical to the amount of the Cash Component and is equal to a proportional
amount of the following: dividends on all the Securities for the period through
the date of redemption, net of accrued expenses and liabilities for such period
not previously deducted (including, without limitation, (x) taxes or other
governmental charges against the Trust not previously deducted, if any, and (y)
accrued fees of the Trustee and other expenses of the Trust (including legal and
auditing expenses) and other expenses not previously deducted (see "Expenses of
the Trust")), plus or minus the Balancing Amount. The redeeming Beneficial Owner
must deliver to the Trustee any amount by which the amount payable to the Trust
by such Beneficial Owner exceeds the amount of the Cash Redemption Payment
("Excess Cash Amounts"). For redemptions outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust will transfer the Cash Redemption
Amount (if required) and the securities to the redeeming Beneficial Owner by the
third (3rd) Business Day following the date on which the request for redemption
is deemed received. In cases in which the Cash Redemption Amount is payable by
the redeemer to the Trustee, the redeeming Beneficial Owner (via the DTC and the
relevant DTC Participants(s)) is required to make payment of such cash amount by
the third (3rd) NSCC Business Day, for redemptions made through the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process, or the first (1st) Business Day, for redemptions outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, following the date on which the request for
redemption is deemed received. The Trustee will cancel all Nasdaq-100 Shares
delivered upon redemption.

     If the Trustee determines that an Index Security is likely to be
unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for delivery by the Trust upon


                                       41

the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations, the
Trustee shall have the right in its discretion to include the cash equivalent
value of such Index Security or Index Securities, based on the market value of
such Index Security or Index Securities as of the Evaluation Time on the date
such redemption is deemed received by the Trustee, in the calculation of the
Cash Redemption Amount in lieu of delivering such Index Security or Index
Securities to the redeemer.

     In connection with the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares, if a redeeming
investor requests redemption in cash, rather than in kind, with respect to one
or more Securities, the Trustee shall have the right in its discretion to
include the cash equivalent value of such Index Security or Index Securities,
based on the market value of such Index Security or Index Securities as of the
Evaluation Time on the date such redemption order is deemed received by the
Trustee, in the calculation of the Cash Redemption Amount in lieu of delivering
such Index Security or Index Securities to the redeemer. In such case, such
investor will pay the Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, plus an additional
amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for a
Creation Unit (see "Summary").

     The Trustee, in its discretion, upon the request of a redeeming investor,
may redeem Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such redeemer with a
portfolio of Securities differing in exact composition from the Index Securities
but not differing in net asset value from the then-current Portfolio Deposit.
Such a redemption is likely to be made only if it were to be determined that
this composition would be appropriate in order to maintain the Portfolio's
correlation to the composition and weighting of the Index.

     The Trustee may sell Securities to obtain sufficient cash proceeds to
deliver to the redeeming Beneficial Owner. To the extent cash proceeds are
received by the Trustee in excess of the amount required to be provided to the
redeeming Beneficial Owner, such cash amounts shall be held by the Trustee and
shall be applied in accordance with the guidelines applicable to Misweightings
(as defined below).

     If the income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other
distributions on the Securities is insufficient to allow distribution of the
Cash Redemption Amount to a redeemer of Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Trustee may
advance out of its own funds any amounts necessary in respect of redemptions of
Nasdaq-100 Shares; otherwise, the Trustee may sell Securities in an amount
sufficient to effect such redemptions. The Trustee may reimburse itself in the
amount of such advance, plus any amounts required by the Federal Reserve Board
which are related to such advance, together with interest thereon at a
percentage rate equal to the then current overnight federal funds rate, by
deducting such amounts from (1) dividend payments or other income of the Trust
when such payments or other income is received, (2) the amounts


                                       42
<PAGE>

earned or benefits derived by the Trustee on cash held by the Trustee for the
benefit of the Trust, and (3) the sale of Securities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that any advance remains outstanding for more than
forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee shall ordinarily sell Securities to
reimburse itself for such advance and any accrued interest thereon. Such
advances will be secured by a lien upon and a security interest in the assets of
the Trust in favor of the Trustee.

     The Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when so directed by the
Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the date of payment of the
NAV for more than five (5) Business Days following the date on which the request
for redemption is deemed received by the Trustee (1) for any period during which
the New York Stock Exchange is closed; (2) for any period during which an
emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the Securities
is not reasonably practicable; or (3) for such other period as the Commission
may by order permit for the protection of Beneficial Owners. Neither the Sponsor
nor the Trustee is liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages
that may result from any such suspension or postponement.

     To be eligible to place orders with the Trustee to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares
in Creation Unit size aggregations, an entity or person must be (1) a
Participating Party, with respect to redemptions through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, or (2) a DTC Participant, with respect to redemptions outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, and in either case must have executed a Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement with the Distributor and the Trustee.

     All orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares must be placed in multiples of
50,000 shares (Creation Unit size). Orders must be transmitted to the Trustee by
telephone or other transmission method acceptable to the Trustee so as to be
received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on the Transmittal Date,
pursuant to procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement. Severe
economic or market changes or disruptions, or telephone or other communication
failure, may impede the ability to reach the Trustee, a Participating Party, or
a DTC Participant.

     Orders to redeem Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares shall
be placed with a Participating Party or DTC Participant, as applicable, in the
form required by such Participating Party or DTC Participant. Investors should
be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement, and that, therefore, orders to redeem Creation Unit size
aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares may have to be placed by the investor's broker
through a Participating Party or a DTC Participant who has executed a Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement. At any given time there may be only a limited number of
broker-dealers that have executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement. Those
placing orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares should afford sufficient time to
permit (1) proper submission of the order by a Participating


                                       43
<PAGE>

Party or DTC Participant to the Trustee and (2) the receipt of the Nasdaq-100
Shares to be redeemed and the Cash Redemption Amount, if any, by the Trustee in
a timely manner, as described below. Orders for redemption that are effected
outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process are likely to require transmittal by the
DTC Participant earlier on the Transmittal Date than orders effected using the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. Those persons placing orders outside the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process should ascertain the deadlines applicable to DTC and the
Federal Reserve Bank wire system by contacting the operations department of the
broker or depository institution effectuating such transfer of Nasdaq-100 Shares
and Cash Redemption Amount. These deadlines will vary by institution. The
Participant notified of an order to redeem outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process will be required to transfer Nasdaq-100 Shares through DTC and the Cash
Redemption Amount, if any, through the Federal Reserve Bank wire system in a
timely manner (see "Placement of Redemption Orders Outside the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process"). Information regarding the Cash Redemption Amount, number of
outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares, and Transaction Fees may be obtained from the
Trustee at the toll-free number: (888) 627-3837.

Placement of Redemption Orders Using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process

     A redemption order using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is deemed received
by the Trustee on the Transmittal Date if (i) such order is received by the
Trustee not later than the Closing Time on such Transmittal Date and (ii) all
other procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement are properly
followed. A redemption order using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process made in
proper form but received by the Trustee after the Closing Time will be deemed
received on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date.
The Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement authorizes the Trustee to transmit to NSCC
on behalf of the Participating Party such trade instructions as are necessary to
effect the Participating Party's redemption order. Pursuant to such trade
instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the Trustee will transfer the requisite
Securities (or contracts to purchase such Securities which are expected to be
delivered in a "regular way" manner through NSCC) by the third (3rd) NSCC
Business Day following the date on which such request for redemption is deemed
received, and the Cash Redemption Amount, if any. If the Cash Redemption Amount
is owed by the Beneficial Owner to the Trustee, such amount must be delivered by
the third (3rd) NSCC Business Day following the date on which the redemption
request is deemed received.

Placement of Redemption Orders Outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process

     A DTC Participant who wishes to place an order for redemption of Nasdaq-100
Shares to be effected outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process need not be a
Participating Party, but such orders must state that the DTC Participant is not
using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process and that redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares
will instead be effected through transfer of Nasdaq-100 Shares directly through
DTC. An order to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process is deemed received by the Trustee on the Transmittal Date if (i) such
order is received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on such
Transmittal Date, (ii) such order is preceded or accompanied by the requisite
number of Nasdaq-100 Shares specified in such order, which delivery must be made
through DTC to the Trustee no later than the Closing Time of the regular trading
session on The Nasdaq Stock Market on such Transmittal Date and (iii) all other
procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement are properly
followed. The Cash Redemption Amount owed by the Beneficial Owner, if any, must
be delivered no later than 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Business Day
immediately following the Transmittal Date.

     The Trustee will initiate procedures to transfer the requisite Securities
and the Cash Redemption Amount to the redeeming Beneficial Owner (where such
amount is payable from the Trustee to the Beneficial Owner) by the third (3rd)
Business Day following the Transmittal Date on which such redemption order is
deemed received by the Trustee.

                                 THE PORTFOLIO

     Because the objective of the Trust is to provide investment results that
generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Index, the
Portfolio will, under most circumstances, consist of all of the Index
Securities. It is anticipated that cash or cash items normally would not be a
substantial part of the Trust's net assets. Although the Trust may at any time
fail to own certain of the Index Securities, the Trust will be substantially
invested in Index Securities and the Sponsor believes that such investment
should result in a close correspondence between the investment performance of
the Index and that derived from ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares.

Adjustments to the Portfolio

     The Index is a modified capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest
non-financial securities listed on the Nasdaq National Market tier of Nasdaq
(see "The Index"). At any moment in time, the value of the Index equals the
aggregate value of the then-current Index share weights of each of the component
Index Securities multiplied by each such security's respective


                                       45
<PAGE>

official closing price on The Nasdaq Stock Market, divided by Adjusted Base
Period Market Value ("ABPMV"), and multiplied by the base value, which results
in the reported Index value. ABPMV serves the purpose of scaling such aggregate
value (otherwise in the trillions) to a lower order of magnitude which is more
desirable for Index reporting purposes.(5)

     Periodically (typically, several times per quarter), Nasdaq may determine
that total shares outstanding have changed in one or more Index Securities due
to secondary offerings, repurchases, conversions, or other corporate actions.
Under such circumstances, in accordance with Nasdaq policies and procedures for
making adjustments to the Index, the Index share weights would be adjusted by
the same percentage amounts by which the total shares outstanding have changed
in such Index Securities. Additionally, Nasdaq may replace one or more component
securities in the Index due to mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, or other
market conditions, or due to removal if an issuer fails to meet the criteria for
continued inclusion in the Index or it chooses to list its securities on another
marketplace. For example, for the 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004
calendar years, there were 6, 15, 5, 6, 6, 1 and 2 company changes,
respectively, made during those years due to corporate actions (e.g., mergers
and acquisitions, bankruptcies) and 9, 15, 12, 13, 15, 8 and 8 other company
changes, respectively, made at year-end in connection with Nasdaq's annual
evaluation process for determining the securities comprising the Index for the
upcoming year (see "The Index-- Initial Eligibility Criteria" and "--Continued
Eligibility Criteria"). The ratio of the market capitalization of the securities
replaced in the Index in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 to the
total market capitalization of the securities comprising the Index at year-end
was 3.1%, 7.2%, 5.1%, 5.1%, 6.2%, 2.20% and 3.0%, respectively.

     The Index share weights, which are based upon the total shares outstanding
in each of the Index Securities, are additionally subject, in certain cases, to
a rebalancing (see "The Index--Rebalancing of the Index"). Ordinarily, whenever
there is a change in Index share weights or a change in a component security
included in the Index, Nasdaq adjusts ABPMV to assure that there is no
discontinuity in the value of the Index which might otherwise be caused by any
such change.

-----------------------
(5)  For example, on December 31, 2004 the aggregate value of the then-current
     Index share weights of each of the Index Securities multiplied by their
     respective last sale price on The Nasdaq Stock Market was $2,526,690,183,
     ABPMV was 194,825,505 on December 31, 2004, the base value was 125, as
     adjusted, at the start of the Index, and the reported Index value was
     1621.12 on December 31, 2004. Please note that the market value and ABPMV
     are in thousands.


                                       46

     Because the investment objective of the Trust is to provide investment
results that generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the
Index, composition and weighting changes, and associated ABPMV changes to the
Index, create the need for the Trustee to make corresponding adjustments to the
Securities held in the Trust as described below.

     The Trust is not managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of
an issuer does not require the sale of stocks from the Portfolio. The Trustee on
a nondiscretionary basis adjusts the composition of the Portfolio from time to
time to conform to changes in the composition and/or weighting of the Index
Securities. The Trustee aggregates certain of these adjustments and makes
conforming changes to the Trust's Portfolio at least monthly; however,
adjustments are made more frequently in the case of changes to the Index that
are significant. Specifically, the Trustee is required to adjust the composition
of the Portfolio at any time that there is a change in the identity of any Index
Security (i.e., a substitution of one security in replacement of another), which
adjustment is to be made within three (3) Business Days before or after the day
on which the change in the identity of such Index Security is scheduled to take
effect at the close of the market. Although the investment objective of the
Trust is to provide investment results which resemble the performance of the
Index, it is not always efficient to replicate identically the share composition
of the Index if the transaction costs incurred by the Trust in so adjusting the
Portfolio would exceed the expected misweighting that would ensue by failing to
replicate identically minor and insignificant share changes to the Index.
Accordingly, to further the investment objective of the Trust, minor
misweightings are generally permitted within the guidelines set forth below. The
Trustee is required to adjust the composition of the Portfolio at any time that
the weighting of any Security varies in excess of one hundred fifty percent
(150%) of a specified percentage (a "Misweighting Amount"), from the weighting
of such Security in the Index (a "Misweighting"). The Misweighting Amounts vary
depending on the net asset value of the Trust and are set forth in the table
below:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                                Misweighting
       Net Asset Value of the Trust                Amount
       ----------------------------             ------------
       <S>                                          <C>
       Less than $25,000,000 ...............        0.25%
       $25,000,000 - $99,999,999 ...........        0.20%
       $100,000,000 - $499,999,999 .........        0.10%
       $500,000,000 - $999,999,999 .........        0.05%
       $1,000,000,000 and over .............        0.02%
</TABLE>

     The Trustee examines each Security in the Portfolio on each Business Day,
comparing the weighting of each such Security in the Portfolio to the weighting
of the corresponding Index Security in the Index, based on prices at the close
of the market on the preceding Business Day (a "Weighting Analysis"). In the
event that there is a Misweighting in any Security in excess


                                       47
<PAGE>

of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the applicable Misweighting Amount, the
Trustee shall calculate an adjustment to the Portfolio in order to bring the
Misweighting of such Security within the Misweighting Amount, based on prices at
the close of the market on the day on which such Misweighting occurs. Also, on a
monthly basis, the Trustee shall perform a Weighting Analysis for each Security
in the Portfolio, and in any case in which there exists a Misweighting exceeding
one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable Misweighting Amount, the Trustee
shall calculate an adjustment to the Portfolio in order to bring the
Misweighting of such Security within the applicable Misweighting Amount, based
on prices at the close of the market on the day on which such Misweighting
occurs. In the case of any adjustment to the Portfolio due to a Misweighting as
described herein, the purchase or sale of securities necessitated by such
adjustment shall be made within three (3) Business Days of the day on which such
Misweighting is determined. In addition to the foregoing adjustments, the
Trustee reserves the right to make additional adjustments periodically to
Securities that may be misweighted by an amount within the applicable
Misweighting Amount in order to reduce the overall Misweighting of the
Portfolio.

     The foregoing guidelines with respect to Misweightings shall also apply to
any Index Security that (1) is likely to be unavailable for delivery or
available in insufficient quantity for delivery or (2) cannot be delivered to
the Trustee due to restrictions prohibiting a creator from engaging in a
transaction involving such Index Security. Upon receipt of an order for a
Creation Unit that will involve such an Index Security, the Trustee shall
determine whether the substitution of cash for such Index Security will cause a
Misweighting in the Trust's Portfolio with respect to such Index Security. If a
Misweighting results, the Trustee shall purchase the required number of shares
of such Index Security on the opening of the market on the following Business
Day. If a Misweighting does not result and the Trustee would not hold cash in
excess of the permitted amounts described below, the Trustee may hold such cash
or, if such an excess would result, make the required adjustments to the
Portfolio in accordance with the procedures described herein.

     Pursuant to these guidelines, the Trustee shall calculate the required
adjustments and shall purchase and sell the appropriate securities. As a result
of the purchase and sale of securities in accordance with these requirements, or
the creation of Creation Units, the Trust may hold some amount of residual cash
(other than cash held temporarily due to timing differences between the sale and
purchase of securities or cash delivered in lieu of Index Securities or
undistributed income or undistributed capital gains) as a result of such
transactions, which amount shall not exceed for more than five (5) consecutive
Business Days 5/10th of 1 percent (0.5%) of the aggregate value of the
Securities. In the event that the Trustee has made all required adjustments and
is left with cash in excess of 5/10th of 1 percent (0.5%) of


                                       48
<PAGE>

the aggregate value of the Securities, the Trustee shall use such cash to
purchase additional Index Securities that are under-weighted in the Portfolio as
compared to their relative weighting in the Index, although the Misweighting of
such Index Securities may not be in excess of the applicable Misweighting
Amount.

     In addition to adjustments to the Portfolio from time to time to conform to
changes in the composition or weighting of the Index Securities, the Trustee is
also ordinarily required to sell Securities to obtain sufficient cash proceeds
for the payment of Trust fees and expenses at any time that projected annualized
fees and expenses accrued on a daily basis exceed projected annualized dividends
and other Trust income accrued on a daily basis by more than 1/100 of one
percent (0.01%) of the net asset value of the Trust. Whenever the 0.01%
threshold is exceeded, the Trustee will sell sufficient Securities to cover such
excess no later than the next occasion it is required to make adjustments to the
Portfolio due to a Misweighting, unless the Trustee determines, in its
discretion, that such a sale is unnecessary because the cash to be generated is
not needed by the Trust at that time for the payment of expenses then due or
because the Trustee otherwise determines that such a sale is not warranted or
advisable. At the time of the sale, the Trustee shall first sell Securities that
are over-weighted in the Portfolio as compared to their relative weighting in
the Index.

     All Portfolio adjustments shall be made by the Trustee pursuant to the
foregoing specifications and as set forth in the Trust Agreement and shall be
nondiscretionary. All portfolio adjustments will be made as described herein
unless such adjustments would cause the Trust to lose its status as a "regulated
investment company" under Subchapter M of the Code. Additionally, the Trustee is
required to adjust the composition of the Portfolio at any time if it is
necessary to ensure the continued qualification of the Trust as a regulated
investment company. The adjustments provided herein are intended to conform the
composition and weighting of the Portfolio, to the extent practicable, to the
composition and weighting of the Index Securities. Such adjustments are based
upon the Index as it is currently determined by Nasdaq. To the extent that the
method of determining the Index is changed by Nasdaq in a manner that would
affect the adjustments provided for herein, the Trustee and the Sponsor shall
have the right to amend the Trust Agreement, without the consent of the DTC or
Beneficial Owners, to conform the adjustments provided herein and in the Trust
Agreement to such changes so that the objective of tracking the Index is
maintained.

     The Trustee relies on information made publicly available by Nasdaq as to
the composition and weighting of the Index Securities. If the Trustee becomes
incapable of obtaining or processing such information or NSCC is unable to
receive such information from the Trustee on any Business Day,


                                       49
<PAGE>

then the Trustee shall use the composition and weighting of the Index Securities
for the most recently effective Portfolio Deposit for the purposes of all
adjustments and determinations described herein (including, without limitation,
determination of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit) until the
earlier of (a) such time as current information with respect to the Index
Securities is available or (b) three (3) consecutive Business Days have elapsed.
If such current information is not available and three (3) consecutive Business
Days have elapsed, the composition and weighting of the Securities (as opposed
to the Index Securities) shall be used for the purposes of all adjustments and
determinations herein (including, without limitation, determination of the
securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit) until current information with
respect to the Index Securities is available.

     If the Trust is terminated, the Trustee shall use the composition and
weighting of the Securities held in the Trust as of the date of notice of the
Trust termination for the purpose and determination of all redemptions or other
required uses of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit.

     From time to time Nasdaq may make adjustments to the composition of the
Index as a result of a merger or acquisition involving one or more of the Index
Securities. In such cases, the Trust, as shareholder of securities of an issuer
that is the object of such merger or acquisition activity, may receive various
offers from would-be acquirers of the issuer. The Trustee is not permitted to
accept any such offers until such time as it has been determined that the
security of the issuer will be removed from the Index. In selling the securities
of such issuer after it has been determined that the security will be removed
from the Index, the Trust may receive, to the extent that market prices do not
provide a more attractive alternative, whatever consideration is being offered
to the shareholders of such issuer that have not tendered their shares prior to
such time. Any cash received in such transactions will be reinvested in Index
Securities in accordance with the criteria set forth above. Any securities
received as a part of the consideration that are not Index Securities will be
sold as soon as practicable and the cash proceeds of such sale will be
reinvested in accordance with the criteria set forth above.

     Purchases and sales of Securities resulting from the adjustments described
above will be made in the share amounts dictated by the foregoing
specifications, whether round lot or odd lot. Certain Index Securities, however,
may at times not be available in the quantities that the foregoing calculations
require. For this and other reasons, precise duplication of the proportionate
relationship between the Portfolio and the Index Securities may not ever be
attained but nevertheless will continue to be the objective of the Trust in
connection with all acquisitions and dispositions of Securities.

     The Trust is a unit investment trust registered under the 1940 Act and is
not a managed fund. Traditional methods of investment management for a


                                       50
<PAGE>

managed fund typically involve frequent changes to a portfolio of securities on
the basis of economic, financial, and market analyses. The Portfolio held by the
Trust, however, is not managed. Instead, the only purchases and sales that are
made with respect to the Portfolio will be those necessary to create a portfolio
that is designed to replicate the Index to the extent practicable, taking into
consideration the adjustments referred to above. Since no attempt is made to
manage the Trust in the traditional sense, the adverse financial condition of an
issuer will not be the basis for the sale of its securities from the Portfolio
unless the issuer is removed from the Index.

     The Trust will be liquidated on the fixed Mandatory Termination Date unless
terminated earlier under certain circumstances. In addition, Beneficial Owners
of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations have the right to redeem
in kind.

Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit

     On each Business Day (each such day, an "Adjustment Day"), the number of
shares and/or identity of each of the Index Securities in a Portfolio Deposit is
adjusted in accordance with the following procedure. Generally, as of the 4:00
p.m. Eastern time market close on each Adjustment Day, the Trustee calculates
the net asset value of the Trust (see "Valuation"). The net asset value is
divided by the number of all outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares multiplied by 50,000
shares in one Creation Unit aggregation resulting in an NAV. The Trustee then
calculates the number of shares (without rounding) of each of the component
securities of the Index in a Portfolio Deposit for the following Business Day
("Request Day"), such that (1) the market value at the close of the market on
Adjustment Day of the securities to be included in the Portfolio Deposit on
Request Day, together with the Income Net of Expense Amount effective for
requests to create or redeem on Adjustment Day, equals the NAV and (2) the
identity and weighting of each of the securities in a Portfolio Deposit mirror
proportionately the identity and weighting of the securities in the Index, each
as in effect on Request Day. For each security, the number resulting from such
calculation is rounded to the nearest whole share, with a fraction of 0.50 being
rounded up. The identities and number of shares of the securities so calculated
constitute the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit effective on Request
Day and thereafter until the next subsequent Adjustment Day, as well as the
Securities ordinarily to be delivered by the Trustee in the event of a request
for redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations on
Request Day and thereafter until the following Adjustment Day (see "Redemption
of Nasdaq-100 Shares"). In addition to the foregoing adjustments, in the event
that there shall occur a stock split, stock dividend, or reverse split with
respect to any Index Security, the Portfolio Deposit shall be adjusted to take
account of such stock split, stock dividend, or reverse split by applying the
stock split, stock


                                       51
<PAGE>

dividend, or reverse stock split multiple (e.g., in the event of a two-for-one
stock split of an Index Security, by doubling the number of shares of such Index
Security in the prescribed Portfolio Deposit), in each case rounded to the
nearest whole share, with a fraction of 0.50 being rounded up.

     On the Request Day and on each day that a request for the creation or
redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares is deemed received, the Trustee calculates the
market value of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit as in effect on
Request Day as of the close of the market and adds to that amount the Income Net
of Expense Amount effective for requests to create or redeem on Request Day
(such market value and Income Net of Expense Amount are collectively referred to
herein as the "Portfolio Deposit Amount"). The Trustee then calculates the NAV,
based on the close of the market on Request Day. The difference between the NAV
so calculated and the Portfolio Deposit Amount is the "Balancing Amount." The
Balancing Amount serves the function of compensating for any differences between
the value of the Portfolio Deposit Amount and the NAV at the close of trading on
Request Day due to, for example, (1) differences in the market value of the
securities in the Portfolio Deposit and the market value of the Securities on
Request Day and (2) any variances from the proper composition of the Portfolio
Deposit.

     On any Adjustment Day on which (a) no change in the identity and/or share
weighting of any Index Security is scheduled to take effect that would cause
ABPMV to be adjusted after the close of the market on such Business Day,(6) and
(b) no stock split, stock dividend, or reverse stock split with respect to any
Index Security has been declared to take effect on the corresponding Request
Day, the Trustee may forego making any adjustment to the securities portion of
the Portfolio Deposit and use the composition and weighting of the Index
Securities for the most recently effective Portfolio Deposit for the Request Day
following such Adjustment Day. In addition, the Trustee may calculate the
adjustment to the number of shares and/or identity of the Index Securities in a
Portfolio Deposit as described above except that such calculation would be
employed two (2) Business Days rather than one (1) Business Day prior to Request
Day.

     The Income Net of Expense Amount and the Balancing Amount in effect at the
close of business on Request Day are collectively referred to as the Cash
Component (with respect to creations of Nasdaq-100 Shares) or the Cash
Redemption Amount (with respect to redemptions of Nasdaq-100 Shares). If the
resulting Cash Component has a positive value, then the creator of Nasdaq-100
Shares will be obligated to pay such cash to the Trustee in

connection with orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares; if the resulting Cash
Component has a negative value, then such cash shall be paid by the Trustee on
behalf of the Trust to the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Similarly, if the
resulting Cash Redemption Amount has a positive value, then such cash shall be
transferred to a redeemer by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust in connection
with orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares; if the resulting Cash Redemption Amount
has a negative value, then such cash shall be paid by the redeemer of Nasdaq-100
Shares to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust.

     In the event that the Trustee has included the cash equivalent value of one
or more Index Securities in the Portfolio Deposit because the Trustee has
determined that such Index Securities are likely to be unavailable or available
in insufficient quantity for delivery, the Portfolio Deposit so constituted
shall dictate the Index Securities to be delivered in connection with the
creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations and upon the
redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations for all
purposes hereunder until such time as the securities portion of the Portfolio
Deposit is subsequently adjusted. Brokerage commissions incurred by the Trustee
in connection with the acquisition of any such Index Securities will be at the
expense of the Trust and will affect the value of all Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     In connection with the creation or redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares, if an
investor is restricted by regulation or otherwise from investing or engaging in
a transaction in one or more Index Securities, the Trustee, in its discretion,
shall have the right to include the cash equivalent value of such Index
Securities in the Portfolio Deposit in the calculation of the Cash Component (or
the Cash Redemption Amount, as the case may be) in lieu of the inclusion of such
Index Securities in the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit for the
particular affected investor. The amount of such cash equivalent payment shall
be used by the Trustee in accordance with the guidelines regarding allowable
Misweightings and permitted amounts of cash which may require the Trustee to
purchase the appropriate number of shares of the Index Security that such
investor was unable to purchase. In any such case, such investor shall pay the
Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, plus an additional amount not to exceed
three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for a Creation Unit.

     The Trustee, in its discretion, upon the request of the redeeming investor,
may redeem Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such redeemer with a
portfolio of Securities differing in exact composition from the Index Securities
but not differing in net asset value from the then-current Portfolio Deposit.
Such a redemption is likely to be made only if it were to be determined that
this composition would be appropriate in order to maintain the Portfolio of the
Trust in correlation to the modified capitalization-weighted composition of the
Index, for instance, in connection with a replacement of one of the Index
Securities (e.g., due to a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy).

                                   THE INDEX

     The Sponsor selected the Nasdaq-100 Index as the basis for the selection of
the Securities to be held by the Trust because, in the opinion of the Sponsor,
the Index constitutes a broadly diversified segment of the largest securities
listed on Nasdaq. Additionally, the Index has achieved wide acceptance by both
investors and market professionals. Specifically, the Index is composed of 100
of the largest non-financial securities listed on the Nasdaq National Market
tier of Nasdaq by market capitalization. In administering the Index, Nasdaq will
exercise reasonable discretion as it deems appropriate.

     The Sponsor, which is wholly owned by Nasdaq, has been granted a license to
use the Index as a basis for determining the composition of the Trust and to use
certain service marks and trademarks of Nasdaq in connection with the Trust (see
"License Agreement"). Nasdaq is not responsible for and shall not participate in
the creation or sale of Nasdaq-100 Shares or in the determination of the timing
of, prices at, or quantities and proportions in which purchases or sales of
Index Securities or Securities shall be made. In addition, Nasdaq determines,
comprises and calculates the Index without regard to the Trust.

     The Index was first published in January 1985 and includes companies across
a variety of major industry groups. The Index does not contain financial
companies, including registered investment companies. As of December 31, 2004,
the major industry groups covered in the Index (listed according to their
respective capitalization in the Index) were as follows: information technology
hardware (33.87%), computer software/services (20.59%), retail/wholesale trade
(12.04%), other services (11.69%), pharmaceuticals & biotechnology (9.72%),
telecommunications (4.31%), manufacturing (3.33%), health (2.54%), consumer
goods (1.13%), and transportation (0.78%). The identity and capitalization
weightings of the five largest companies represented in the Index as of December
31, 2004 were as follows: Microsoft Corporation (7.43%), QUALCOMM Inc. (6.23%),
eBay Inc. (4.27%), Intel Corporation (3.85%) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (3.38%).
Current information regarding the market value of the Index is available from
Nasdaq as well as numerous market information services.

Initial Eligibility Criteria*

     To be eligible for initial inclusion in the Index, a security must be
listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and meet the following criteria:


                                       55
<PAGE>

     o    the security's U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq National
          Market (unless the security was dually listed on another U.S. market
          prior to January 1, 2004 and has continuously maintained such
          listing);

     o    the security must be of a non-financial company;

     o    the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy
          proceedings;

     o    the security must have average daily trading volume of at least
          200,000 shares;

     o    if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a
          jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed
          options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be eligible for
          listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S.;

     o    only one class of security per issuer is allowed;

     o    the issuer of the security may not have entered into a definitive
          agreement or other arrangement which would likely result in the
          security no longer being Index eligible;

     o    the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements
          with an audit opinion which the auditor or the company has indicated
          cannot be currently relied upon;

     o    the issuer of the security must have "seasoned" on Nasdaq or another
          recognized market (generally, a company is considered to be seasoned
          if it has been listed on a market for at least two years; in the case
          of spin-offs, the operating history of the spin-off will be
          considered); and

     o    if the security would otherwise qualify to be in the top 25% of the
          securities included in the Index by market capitalization for the six
          prior consecutive month-ends, then a one-year "seasoning" criterion
          would apply.

Continued Eligibility Criteria*

     To be eligible for continued inclusion in the Index, the following criteria
apply:

     o    the security's U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq National
          Market (unless the security was dually listed on another U.S. market
          prior to January 1, 2004 and has continuously maintained such
          listing);

     o    the security must be of a non-financial company;

     o    the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy
          proceedings;


                                       56
<PAGE>

     o    the security must have average daily trading volume of at least
          200,000 shares (measured annually during the ranking review process);

     o    if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a
          jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed
          options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be eligible for
          listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S.
          (measured annually during the ranking review process);

     o    the security must have an adjusted market capitalization equal to or
          exceeding 0.10% of the aggregate adjusted market capitalization of the
          Index at each month-end. In the event a company does not meet this
          criterion for two consecutive month-ends, it will be removed from the
          Index effective after the close of trading on the third Friday of the
          following month; and

     o    the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements
          with an audit opinion which the auditor or the company has indicated
          cannot be currently relied upon.

     These Index eligibility criteria may be revised from time to time by Nasdaq
without regard to the Trust.

Ranking Review

     Except under extraordinary circumstances that may result in an interim
evaluation, Index composition is reviewed on an annual basis as follows (such
evaluation is referred to herein as the "Ranking Review"). Securities listed on
The Nasdaq Stock Market which meet the applicable eligibility criteria (above)
are ranked by market value. Index-eligible securities which are already in the
Index and which are ranked in the top 100 eligible securities (based on market
value) are retained in the Index. A security that is ranked 101 to 125 is also
retained, provided that such security was ranked in the top 100 eligible
securities as of the previous Ranking Review. Securities not meeting such
criteria are replaced. The replacement securities chosen are those
Index-eligible securities not currently in the Index that have the largest
market capitalization. Generally, the list of annual additions and deletions is
publicly announced via a press release in the early part of December.
Replacements are made effective after the close of trading on the third Friday
in December. Moreover, if at any time during the year an Index Security is
determined by Nasdaq to become ineligible for continued inclusion in the Index
based on the Continued Eligibility Criteria (above), the security will be
replaced with the largest market capitalization security not currently in the
Index and meeting the Initial Index eligibility criteria listed above.

     In addition to the Ranking Review, the securities in the Index are
monitored every day by Nasdaq with respect to changes in total shares


                                       57
<PAGE>

outstanding arising from secondary offerings, stock repurchases, conversions, or
other corporate actions. Nasdaq has adopted the following weight adjustment
procedures with respect to such changes. Changes arising from stock splits,
stock dividends, or spin-offs are generally made to the Index on the evening
prior to the effective date of such corporate action. If the change in total
shares outstanding arising from other corporate actions is greater than or equal
to 5.0%, the change will be made as soon as practicable, normally within ten
(10) days of such action. Otherwise, if the change in total shares outstanding
is less than 5%, then all such changes are accumulated and made effective at one
time on a quarterly basis after the close of trading on the third Friday in each
of March, June, September, and December. In any case, the Index share weights
for such Index Securities are adjusted by the same percentage amount by which
the total shares outstanding have changed in such Index Securities.

     * For the purposes of Index eligibility criteria, if the security is a
depositary receipt representing a security of a non-U.S. issuer, then references
to the "issuer" are references to the issuer of the underlying security.

Calculation of the Index

     The Index is a modified capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest
non-financial securities listed on the Nasdaq National Market tier of Nasdaq.
The value of the Index equals the aggregate value of the Index share weights of
each of the component Index Securities multiplied by each such security's
respective official closing price on The Nasdaq Stock Market, divided by ABPMV,
and multiplied by the base value. ABPMV serves the purpose of scaling such
aggregate value (otherwise in the trillions) to a lower order of magnitude which
is more desirable for Index reporting purposes. Ordinarily, whenever there is a
change in Index share weights or a change in a component security included in
the Index, Nasdaq adjusts ABPMV to assure that there is no discontinuity in the
value of the Index which might otherwise be caused by any such change.
Accordingly, each Index Security's influence on the value of the Index is
directly proportional to the value of its weight in the Index. The Index share
weights noted above, which are based upon the total shares outstanding in each
of the Index Securities, are additionally subject, in certain cases, to a
rebalancing (see "The Index-Rebalancing of the Index"). The percentage of the
Trust's assets invested in each of the Index Securities is intended to
approximate the percentage each Index Security represents in the Index.


                                       58
<PAGE>

Rebalancing of the Index

     Effective after the close of trading on December 18, 1998, the Index has
been calculated under a "modified capitalization-weighted" methodology, which is
a hybrid between equal weighting and conventional capitalization weighting. This
methodology is expected to: (1) retain in general the economic attributes of
capitalization weighting; (2) promote portfolio weight diversification (thereby
limiting domination of the Index by a few large stocks); (3) reduce Index
performance distortion by preserving the capitalization ranking of companies;
and (4) reduce market impact on the smallest Index Securities from necessary
weight rebalancings.

     Under the methodology employed, on a quarterly basis coinciding with
Nasdaq's quarterly scheduled weight adjustment procedures, the Index Securities
are categorized as either "Large Stocks" or "Small Stocks" depending on whether
their current percentage weights (after taking into account such scheduled
weight adjustments due to stock repurchases, secondary offerings, or other
corporate actions) are greater than, or less than or equal to, the average
percentage weight in the Index (i.e., as a 100-stock index, the average
percentage weight in the Index is 1.0%).

     Such quarterly examination will result in an Index rebalancing if either
one or both of the following two weight distribution requirements are not met:
(1) the current weight of the single largest market capitalization Index
Security must be less than or equal to 24.0% and (2) the "collective weight" of
those Index Securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5%,
when added together, must be less than or equal to 48.0%. In addition, Nasdaq
may conduct a special rebalancing if it is determined necessary to maintain the
integrity of the Index.

     If either one or both of these weight distribution requirements are not met
upon quarterly review or Nasdaq determines that a special rebalancing is
required, a weight rebalancing will be performed. First, relating to weight
distribution requirement (1) above, if the current weight of the single largest
Index Security exceeds 24.0%, then the weights of all Large Stocks will be
scaled down proportionately towards 1.0% by enough for the adjusted weight of
the single largest Index Security to be set to 20.0%. Second, relating to weight
distribution requirement (2) above, for those Index Securities whose individual
current weights or adjusted weights in accordance with the preceding step are in
excess of 4.5%, if their "collective weight" exceeds 48.0%, then the weights of
all Large Stocks will be scaled down proportionately towards 1.0% by just enough
for the "collective weight," so adjusted, to be set to 40.0%.

     The aggregate weight reduction among the Large Stocks resulting from either
or both of the above rescalings will then be redistributed to the Small Stocks
in the following iterative manner. In the first iteration, the weight of


                                       59
<PAGE>

the largest Small Stock will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal
to the average Index weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller
remaining Small Stocks will be scaled up by the same factor reduced in relation
to each stock's relative ranking among the Small Stocks such that the smaller
the Index Security in the ranking, the less the scale-up of its weight. This is
intended to reduce the market impact of the weight rebalancing on the smallest
component securities in the Index.

     In the second iteration, the weight of the second largest Small Stock,
already adjusted in the first iteration, will be scaled upwards by a factor
which sets it equal to the average index weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of
the smaller remaining Small Stocks will be scaled up by this same factor reduced
in relation to each stock's relative ranking among the Small Stocks such that,
once again, the smaller the stock in the ranking, the less the scale-up of its
weight.

     Additional iterations will be performed until the accumulated increase in
weight among the Small Stocks exactly equals the aggregate weight reduction
among the Large Stocks from rebalancing in accordance with weight distribution
requirement (1) and/or weight distribution requirement (2).

     Then, to complete the rebalancing procedure, once the final percent weights
of each Index Security are set, the Index share weights will be determined anew
based upon the official closing prices and aggregate capitalization of the Index
at the close of trading on the Thursday in the week immediately preceding the
week of the third Friday in March, June, September, and December. Changes to the
Index share weights will be made effective after the close of trading on the
third Friday in March, June, September, and December and an adjustment to ABPMV
will be made to ensure continuity of the Index.

     Ordinarily, new rebalanced weights will be determined by applying the above
procedures to the current Index share weights. However, Nasdaq may from time to
time determine rebalanced weights, if necessary, by instead applying the above
procedure to the actual current market capitalization of the Index components.
In such instances, Nasdaq would announce the different basis for rebalancing
prior to its implementation.

                              MARKETPLACE LISTING

     Nasdaq-100 Shares are listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Market tier
of Nasdaq. Previously (prior to December 1, 2004), Nasdaq-100 Shares were listed
on the Amex. Transactions involving Nasdaq-100 Shares in the public trading
market are subject to customary brokerage charges and commissions.

     The Sponsor's aim in designing Nasdaq-100 Shares was to provide investors
with a security whose initial market value would approximate one-fortieth
(1/40th) the value of the Index. The market price of a Nasdaq-100 Share may be
affected by supply and demand for the underlying securities, market volatility,
sentiment, and other factors. Note also, that due to these factors as well as
other factors, including required distributions for tax purposes (see "Tax
Status of the Trust") or the sale of Securities to meet Trust expenses in excess
of the dividends received on the Securities (see "Expenses of the Trust"), the
one-fortieth (1/40th) relationship between the initial value of a Nasdaq-100
Share and the value of the Index is not expected to persist indefinitely.

     There can be no assurance that Nasdaq-100 Shares will always be listed on
Nasdaq. Nasdaq will consider the suspension of trading in or removal from
listing of Nasdaq-100 Shares: (a) if the Trust has more than 60 days remaining
until termination and there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial holders
of Nasdaq-100 Shares for 30 or more consecutive trading days; (b) if the Index
is no longer calculated or available; or (c) if such other event shall occur or
condition exists which, in the opinion of Nasdaq, makes further dealings on
Nasdaq inadvisable.

     The Trust will be terminated in the event that Nasdaq-100 Shares are
delisted from Nasdaq and are not subsequently relisted on a national securities
exchange or a quotation medium operated by a national securities association
(see "Administration of the Trust--Termination").

                            TAX STATUS OF THE TRUST

     For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Trust qualified for tax
treatment as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Code.
The Trust intends to continue to so qualify. To qualify as a regulated
investment company, the Trust must, among other things, (a) derive in each
taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, gains
from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies,
or certain other sources, (b) meet certain diversification tests, and (c)
distribute in each year at least 90% of its investment company taxable income.
If the Trust qualifies as a regulated investment company, subject to certain
conditions and requirements, the Trust will not be subject to federal income tax
to the extent its income is distributed in a timely manner. Any undistributed
income may be subject to tax, including a four percent (4%) excise tax imposed
by section


                                       62
<PAGE>

4982 of the Code on certain undistributed income of a regulated investment
company that does not distribute to shareholders in a timely manner at least
ninety-eight percent (98%) of its taxable income (including capital gains).

Tax Consequences to Beneficial Owners

     Any net dividends paid by the Trust from its investment company taxable
income (which includes dividends, interest, and the excess of net short-term
capital gains over net long-term capital losses) will be taxable to Beneficial
Owners as ordinary income. Non-corporate holders, however, will be eligible for
a special 15% maximum tax rate for qualified dividend income through 2008 to the
extent the Trust's dividends are designated by the Trust as attributable to
qualified dividend income received by the Trust (generally, dividends received
by the Trust from domestic corporations and certain foreign corporations). A net
dividend, if any, paid in January will be considered for federal income tax
purposes to have been paid by the Trust and received by Beneficial Owners on the
preceding December 31 if the net dividend was declared in the preceding October,
November, or December to Beneficial Owners of record shown on the records of the
DTC and the DTC Participants (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System") on a date
in one of those months.

     Distributions paid by the Trust from the excess of net long-term capital
gains over net short-term capital losses ("net capital gain") are taxable as
long-term capital gain, regardless of the length of time an investor has owned
Nasdaq-100 Shares. Any loss on the sale or exchange of a Nasdaq-100 Share held
for six months or less may be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent
of any capital gain dividends received by the Beneficial Owner. For corporate
investors, net dividends from net investment income (but not return of capital
distributions or capital gain dividends) generally will qualify for the
corporate dividends-received deduction to the extent of qualifying dividend
income received by the Trust, subject to the limitations contained in the Code.
Investors should note that the quarterly net dividends paid by the Trust, if
any, will not be based on the Trust's investment company taxable income and net
capital gain, but rather will be based on the dividends paid with respect to the
Securities net of accrued expenses and liabilities of the Trust. As a result, a
portion of the distributions of the Trust may be treated as a return of capital
or a capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes or the Trust may make
additional distributions in excess of the yield performance of the Securities in
order to distribute all of its investment company taxable income and net capital
gain.

     Distributions in excess of the Trust's current or accumulated earnings and
profits (as specially computed) generally will be treated as a return of capital
for federal income tax purposes and will reduce a Beneficial Owner's tax


                                       63
<PAGE>

basis in Nasdaq-100 Shares. Return of capital distributions may result, for
example, if a portion of the net dividends, if any, declared represents cash
amounts deposited in connection with Portfolio Deposits rather than dividends
actually received by the Trust. Under certain circumstances, a significant
portion of any quarterly net dividends of the Trust could be treated as return
of capital distributions. Such circumstances may be more likely to occur in
periods during which the number of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares fluctuates
significantly, as may occur during the initial years of the Trust. Beneficial
Owners will receive annual notification from the Trustee through the DTC
Participants as to the tax status of the Trust's distributions (see "The Trust--
Book-Entry-Only System"). A distribution, if any, paid shortly after a purchase
or creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares may be taxable even though in effect it may
represent a return of capital.

     The sale of Nasdaq-100 Shares by a Beneficial Owner is a taxable event, and
may result in a gain or loss, which generally should be a capital gain or loss
for Beneficial Owners that are not dealers in securities.

     Under the Code, an in-kind redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares will not result
in the recognition of taxable gain or loss by the Trust but generally will
constitute a taxable event for the redeeming shareholder. Upon redemption, a
Beneficial Owner generally will recognize gain or loss measured by the
difference on the date of redemption between the aggregate value of the cash and
securities received and its tax basis in the Nasdaq-100 Shares redeemed.
Securities received upon redemption (which will be comprised of the securities
portion of the Portfolio Deposit in effect on the date of redemption) generally
will have an initial tax basis equal to their respective market values on the
date of redemption. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") may assert that
any resulting loss may not be deducted by a Beneficial Owner on the basis that
there has been no material change in such Beneficial Owner's economic position
or that the transaction has no significant economic or business utility apart
from the anticipated tax consequences. Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
Creation Unit size aggregations should consult their own tax advisors as to the
consequences to them of the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     Net dividend distributions, capital gains distributions, and capital gains
from sales or redemptions may also be subject to state, local and foreign taxes.

     Deposit of a Portfolio Deposit with the Trustee in exchange for Nasdaq-100
Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations will not result in the recognition of
taxable gain or loss by the Trust but generally will constitute a taxable event
to the depositor under the Code, and a depositor generally will recognize gain
or loss with respect to each security deposited equal to the difference between
the amount realized in respect of the security and the depositor's tax basis
therein. The amount realized with respect to a security


                                       64
<PAGE>

deposited should be determined by allocating the value on the date of deposit of
the Nasdaq-100 Shares received (less any cash paid to the Trust, or plus any
cash received from the Trust, in connection with the deposit) among the
securities deposited on the basis of their respective fair market values at that
time. The IRS may assert that any resulting losses may not be deducted by a
depositor on the basis that there has been no material change in the depositor's
economic position or that the transaction has no significant economic or
business utility or purpose apart from the anticipated tax consequences.
Depositors should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences to
them of a deposit to the Trust.

     The Trustee has the right to reject the order to create Creation Units
transmitted to it by the Distributor if the depositor or group of depositors,
upon obtaining the Nasdaq-100 Shares ordered, would own eighty percent (80%) or
more of the outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares, and if pursuant to section 351 of the
Code such a circumstance would result in the Trust having a basis in the
securities deposited different from the market value of such securities on the
date of deposit. The Trustee has the right to require information regarding
Nasdaq-100 Share ownership pursuant to the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement and
from the DTC and to rely thereon to the extent necessary to make the foregoing
determination as a condition to the acceptance of a Portfolio Deposit.

     Ordinary income dividends received via DTC by Beneficial Owners who are
nonresident aliens will be subject to a thirty percent (30%) United States
withholding tax unless a reduced rate of withholding or a withholding exemption
is provided under applicable tax treaties. Nonresident shareholders are urged to
consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of United States
withholding tax.

     Backup withholding at a current rate of 28% will apply to dividends,
capital gain distributions, redemptions and sales of Nasdaq-100 Shares unless
(a) the Beneficial Owner is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt
categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact, or (b) provides a
taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup
withholding, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a
Beneficial Owner will be allowed as a credit against the holder's U.S. federal
income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund from the IRS,
provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.

     The tax discussion set forth above is included for general information
only. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the
federal, state, local, and foreign tax consequences to them of an investment in
the Trust, including the effect of possible legislative changes.

<PAGE>

                             ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

     In considering the advisability of an investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares,
fiduciaries of pension, profit sharing, or other tax-qualified retirement plans
(including Keogh Plans) and welfare plans (collectively, "Plans") subject to the
fiduciary responsibility requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), should consider whether an investment in
Nasdaq-100 Shares is permitted by the documents and instruments governing the
Plan and whether the investment satisfies the exclusive benefit, prudence, and
diversification requirements of ERISA. Individual retirement account ("IRA")
investors should consider that an IRA may make only such investments as are
authorized by its governing instruments.

     The fiduciary standards and prohibited transactions rules of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code will not apply to transactions involving the Trust's
assets while Nasdaq-100 Shares are held by a Plan or IRA. Unlike many other
investment vehicles offered to Plans and IRAs, the Trust's assets will not be
treated as "plan assets" of the Plans or IRAs which acquire or purchase
Nasdaq-100 Shares. Although ERISA imposes certain duties on Plan fiduciaries and
ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving
"plan assets" between Plans or IRAs and their fiduciaries or certain related
persons, those rules will not apply to transactions involving the Trust's assets
because Nasdaq-100 Shares represent an interest in the Trust, and the Trust is
registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"). ERISA, the Code, and U.S. Department of Labor
regulations contain unconditional language exempting the assets of registered
investment companies from treatment as "plan assets" in applying the fiduciary
and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code.

     Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section
3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and
foreign plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the
requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. The fiduciaries of
governmental plans should, however, consider the impact of their respective
state pension codes on investments in the Nasdaq-100 Shares and the
considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable.

                   CONTINUOUS OFFERING OF NASDAQ-100 SHARES

     Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations are offered
continuously to the public by the Trust through the Distributor and are
delivered upon the deposit of a Portfolio Deposit (see "The Trust--Procedures
for Creation of Creation Units"). Persons making Portfolio Deposits and creating
Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares will receive no fees,
commissions, or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind


                                       66
<PAGE>

from the Sponsor or the Distributor, nor will any such person have any
obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or Distributor to effect any sale or
resale of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Sponsor reserves the
right, in its sole discretion, to periodically reimburse in whole or in part the
Transaction Fees paid by eligible entities in connection with the creation or
redemption of certain lot-sizes of Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     Because new Nasdaq-100 Shares can be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Trust a "distribution," as such term
is used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), may be
occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities
on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed
participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them statutory
underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability
provisions of the Securities Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm or its
client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after
placing a creation order with the Distributor, breaks them down into the
constituent Nasdaq-100 Shares, and sells the Nasdaq-100 Shares directly to its
customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Nasdaq-100
Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market
demand for Nasdaq-100 Shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter
must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the
activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the
examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all
the activities that could lead to categorization as an underwriter.

     Dealers who are not "underwriters" but are participating in a distribution
(as contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions), and thus dealing
with Nasdaq-100 Shares that are part of an "unsold allotment" within the meaning
of Section 4(3)(C) of the Securities Act, would be unable to take advantage of
the prospectus-delivery exemption provided by Section 4(3) of the Securities
Act.

     The Sponsor intends to market Nasdaq-100 Shares through broker-dealers who
are members of the NASD. Investors intending to create or redeem Creation Unit
size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares in transactions not involving a
broker-dealer registered in such investor's state of domicile or residence
should consult counsel regarding applicable broker-dealer or securities
regulatory requirements under such state securities laws prior to such creation
or redemption.

                              EXPENSES OF THE TRUST

     Until the Sponsor determines otherwise, the Sponsor has undertaken that the
ordinary operating expenses of the Trust will not be permitted to exceed 0.20%
per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust. If the ordinary


                                       67
<PAGE>

operating expenses of the Trust exceed such 0.20% level, the Sponsor will
reimburse the Trust or assume invoices on behalf of the Trust for such excess
ordinary operating expenses. The Sponsor retains the ability to be repaid by the
Trust for expenses so reimbursed or assumed to the extent that subsequently
during the fiscal year expenses fall below the 0.20% per annum level on any
given day. Ordinary operating expenses of the Trust do not include taxes,
brokerage commissions, and such extraordinary nonrecurring expenses as may
arise, including without limitation the cost of any litigation to which the
Trust or Trustee may be a party. The Sponsor may discontinue its undertaking to
limit ordinary operating expenses of the Trust or renew this undertaking for an
additional period of time, or may choose to reimburse or assume certain Trust
expenses in later periods in order to keep Trust expenses at a level lower than
what would reflect ordinary operating expenses of the Trust, but is not
obligated to do so. In any event, it is possible that, on any day and during any
period over the life of the Trust, total fees and expenses of the Trust may
exceed 0.20% per annum.

     Subject to any applicable cap, the Sponsor reserves the right to charge the
Trust a special sponsor fee from time to time in reimbursement for certain
services it may provide to the Trust which would otherwise be provided by the
Trustee in an amount not to exceed the actual cost of providing such services.
The Sponsor or the Trustee from time to time may voluntarily assume some
expenses or reimburse the Trust so that total expenses of the Trust are reduced,
although neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is obligated to do so and either
one or both parties may discontinue such voluntary assumption of expenses or
reimbursement at any time without notice.

     The following charges are or may be accrued and paid by the Trust: (a) the
Trustee's fee as discussed more fully below; (b) fees payable to transfer agents
for the provision of transfer agency services; (c) fees of the Trustee for
extraordinary services performed under the Trust Agreement; (d) various
governmental charges; (e) any taxes, fees, and charges payable by the Trustee
with respect to Nasdaq-100 Shares (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or
otherwise); (f) expenses and costs of any action taken by the Trustee or the
Sponsor to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of Beneficial Owners
of Nasdaq-100 Shares (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or otherwise);
(g) indemnification of the Trustee or the Sponsor for any losses, liabilities or
expenses incurred by them in the administration of the Trust without gross
negligence, bad faith, wilful misconduct, or wilful malfeasance on their part or
reckless disregard of their obligations and duties; (h) expenses incurred in
contacting Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares during the life of the Trust
and upon termination of the Trust; (i) brokerage commissions incurred by the
Trustee when acquiring or selling Index


                                       68
<PAGE>

Securities pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement; and (j) other
out-of-pocket expenses of the Trust incurred pursuant to actions permitted or
required under the Trust Agreement.

     In addition to the specific expenses discussed in the previous paragraph,
the following expenses are or may be charged to the Trust: (a) reimbursement to
the Sponsor of amounts paid by it to Nasdaq in respect of annual licensing fees
pursuant to the License Agreement, (b) federal and state annual registration
fees for the issuance of Nasdaq-100 Shares, and (c) expenses of the Sponsor
relating to the printing and distribution of marketing materials describing
Nasdaq-100 Shares and the Trust (including, but not limited to, associated
legal, audit, consulting, advertising, and marketing costs and other
out-of-pocket expenses such as printing). Pursuant to the provisions of an
exemptive order, the expenses set forth in this paragraph may be charged to the
Trust by the Trustee in an amount equal to the actual costs incurred, but in no
case shall such charges exceed 20/100 of 1% (0.20%) per annum of the daily net
asset value of the Trust.

     If income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other
distributions on the Securities is insufficient to cover Trust fees and
expenses, the Trustee will sell Securities in an amount sufficient to pay the
excess of accrued fees and expenses over the dividends and other Trust accrued
income. Specifically, the Trustee will ordinarily be required to sell Securities
whenever the Trustee determines that projected annualized fees and expenses
accrued on a daily basis exceed projected annualized dividends and other Trust
income accrued on a daily basis by more than 1/100 of one percent (0.01%) of the
net asset value of the Trust. Whenever the 0.01% threshold is exceeded, the
Trustee will sell sufficient Securities to cover such excess no later than the
next occasion it is required to make adjustments to the Portfolio due to a
Misweighting (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio"), unless the
Trustee determines, in its discretion, that such a sale is unnecessary because
the cash to be generated is not needed by the Trust at that time for the payment
of expenses then due or because the Trustee otherwise determines that such sale
is not warranted or advisable. At the time of the sale, the Trustee shall first
sell Securities that are over-weighted in the Portfolio as compared to their
relative weighting in the Index.

     The Trustee may also make advances to the Trust to cover expenses. The
Trustee may reimburse itself in the amount of any such advance, plus any amounts
required by the Federal Reserve Board which are related to such advances,
together with interest thereon at a percentage rate equal to the then-current
overnight federal funds rate, by deducting such amounts from (1) dividend
payments or other income of the Trust when such payments or other income is
received, (2) the amounts earned or benefits derived by the Trustee on cash held
by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust, and (3) the


                                       69
<PAGE>

sale of Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any advance
remains outstanding for more than forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee
shall ordinarily sell Securities to reimburse itself for the amount of such
advance and any accrued interest thereon. Such advances, as well as rights of
the Trustee to the payment of its fee, reimbursement of expenses and other
claims, will be secured by a lien upon and a security interest in the assets of
the Trust in favor of the Trustee. The expenses of the Trust are reflected in
the net asset value of the Trust (see "Valuation").

     For services performed under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is paid by
the Trust a fee at an annual rate of 4/100 of 1% to 10/100 of 1% of the net
asset value of the Trust, as shown below, such percentage amount to vary
depending on the net asset value of the Trust. Such compensation is computed on
each Business Day on the basis of the net asset value of the Trust on such day,
and the amount thereof is accrued daily and paid monthly. The Trustee, in its
discretion, may waive all or a portion of such fee. Notwithstanding the fee
schedule set forth in the table below, the Trustee shall be paid a minimum
annual fee of $180,000 per annum. To the extent that the amount of the Trustee's
compensation is less than such minimum annual fee, the Sponsor has agreed to pay
the amount of any such shortfall.

                                   VALUATION

     The NAV of the Trust is computed as of the Evaluation Time shown under
"Summary-Essential Information" on each Business Day. The NAV of the Trust on a
per Nasdaq-100 Share basis is determined by subtracting all liabilities
(including accrued expenses and dividends payable) from the total value of the
Trust's investments and other assets and dividing the result by the total number
of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     The aggregate value of the Securities shall be determined by the Trustee in
good faith in the following manner. The value of a Security shall generally


                                       70
<PAGE>

be based on the Nasdaq official closing price for the Security on that day
(unless the Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) on
The Nasdaq Stock Market or, if there is no such appropriate closing sale price
on The Nasdaq Stock Market, at the closing bid price (unless the Trustee deems
such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation). If a Security is not so
quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market or, if so quoted and the principal market
therefor is other than on The Nasdaq Stock Market or there is no such closing
bid price available, such evaluation shall generally be made by the Trustee in
good faith based (a) on the closing price for the Security on another market on
which the Security is traded, if available, or otherwise based on the closing
sale price on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the last day that the security traded
(unless the Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) or
if there is no such appropriate closing price, at the closing bid price on such
other market, (b) on current bid prices on The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other
markets, (c) if bid prices are not available, on the basis of current bid prices
for comparable securities, (d) by the Trustee's appraising the value of the
Securities in good faith on the bid side of the market, or (e) by any
combination thereof.

                           ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST

Distributions to Beneficial Owners

     The regular quarterly ex-dividend date with respect to net dividends, if
any, for Nasdaq-100 Shares is the third Friday in each of March, June,
September, and December, unless such day is not a Business Day, in which case
the ex-dividend date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. Beneficial
Owners as reflected on the records of the DTC and the DTC Participants on the
second Business Day following the ex-dividend date (the "Record Date") are
entitled to receive an amount, if any, representing dividends accumulated on the
Securities through the quarterly Accumulation Period which ends on the Business
Day preceding such ex-dividend date (including Securities with ex-dividend dates
falling within such quarterly dividend period) and other income, if any,
received by the Trust, net of the fees and expenses of the Trust, accrued daily
for such period. For the purposes of such distributions, dividends per
Nasdaq-100 Share are calculated at least to the nearest 1/100th of $0.01.
However, there shall be no net dividend distribution in any given quarter, and
any net dividend amounts will be rolled into the next Accumulation Period, if
the aggregate net dividend distribution would be in an amount less than 5/100 of
one percent (0.05%) of the net asset value of the Trust as of the Friday in the
week immediately preceding the ex-dividend date, unless the Trustee determines
that such net dividend distribution is required to be made in order to maintain
the Trust's status as a regulated investment company or to avoid the imposition
of


                                       71
<PAGE>

income or excise taxes on undistributed income (see "Tax Status of the Trust").
When net dividend payments are to be made by the Trust, payment will be made on
the last Business Day in the calendar month following each ex-dividend date (the
"Dividend Payment Date").

     Dividends payable to the Trust in respect of the Securities are credited by
the Trustee to a non-interest bearing account as of the date on which the Trust
receives such dividends. Other moneys received by the Trustee in respect of the
Securities, including but not limited to the Cash Component, the Cash Redemption
Amount, all moneys realized by the Trustee from the sale of options, warrants,
or other similar rights received or distributed in respect of the Securities as
dividends or distributions and capital gains resulting from the sale of
Securities, are also credited by the Trustee to a non-interest bearing account.
All funds collected or received are held by the Trustee without interest until
distributed or otherwise utilized in accordance with the provisions of the Trust
Agreement. To the extent the amounts credited to such accounts generate interest
income or an equivalent benefit to the Trustee, such interest income or benefit
is used to reduce any charges made in connection with advances made by the
Trustee on behalf of the Trust to cover Trust expenses in those cases when the
Trust income is insufficient to pay such expenses when due (see "Expenses of the
Trust").

     The Trust has qualified, and intends to continue to qualify, as a regulated
investment company for federal income tax purposes. A regulated investment
company is not subject to federal income tax on its net investment income and
capital gains that it distributes to shareholders, so long as it meets certain
overall distribution and diversification requirements and other conditions under
Subchapter M of the Code. The Trust intends to satisfy these overall
distribution and diversification requirements and to otherwise satisfy any
required conditions. The Trustee intends to make additional distributions to the
minimum extent necessary (i) to distribute the entire annual investment company
taxable income of the Trust, plus any net capital gains (from sales of
securities in connection with adjustments to the Portfolio, payment of the
expenses of the Trust, or to generate cash for such distributions), and (ii) to
avoid imposition of the excise tax imposed by section 4982 of the Code. The
additional distributions, if needed, would consist of (a) any amount by which
estimated Trust investment company taxable income and net capital gains for a
fiscal year exceed the amount of Trust taxable income previously distributed
with respect to such year or, if greater, the minimum amount required to avoid
imposition of such excise tax, and (b) a distribution soon after the actual
annual investment company taxable income and net capital gains of the Trust have
been computed of the amount, if any, by which such actual income exceeds the
distributions already made. The net asset value of the Trust will be reduced by
the amount of such additional distributions. The magnitude of the additional
distributions, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including the level


                                       72
<PAGE>

of redemption activity experienced by the Trust. Because substantially all
proceeds from the sale of Securities in connection with adjustments to the
Portfolio will have been used to purchase shares of Index Securities, the Trust
may have no cash or insufficient cash with which to pay any such additional
distributions. In that case, the Trustee typically will have to sell shares of
the Securities sufficient to produce the cash required to make such additional
distributions. In selecting the Securities to be sold to produce cash for such
distributions, the Trustee will choose among the Securities that are
over-weighted in the Portfolio relative to their weighting in the Index first
and then from among all other Securities in a manner so as to maintain the
weighting of each of the Securities within the applicable Misweighting Amount.

     The Trustee may declare special dividends if, in its reasonable discretion,
such action is necessary or advisable to preserve the status of the Trust as a
regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on
undistributed income.

     The Trustee may vary the frequency with which periodic distributions, if
any, are to be made from the Trust (e.g., from quarterly to semi-annually) if it
is determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee, in their discretion, that such a
variance would be advisable to facilitate compliance with the rules and
regulations applicable to regulated investment companies or would otherwise be
advantageous to the Trust. In addition, the Trustee reserves the right to change
the regular ex-dividend date for Nasdaq-100 Shares to another regular date if it
is determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee, in their discretion, that such a
change would be advantageous to the Trust. Notice of any such variance or change
(which notice shall include changes to the Record Date, the ex-dividend date,
the Dividend Payment Date, and the Accumulation Period resulting from such
variance) shall be provided to Beneficial Owners via the DTC and the DTC
Participants (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").

     The Trustee may advance out of its own funds any amounts necessary to
permit distributions via the DTC to Beneficial Owners. The Trustee may reimburse
itself in the amount of such advance, together with interest thereon at a
percentage rate equal to the then current overnight federal funds rate, plus
Federal Reserve Bank requirements, by deducting such amounts from (1) dividend
payments or other income of the Trust when such payments or other income is
received, (2) the amounts earned or benefits derived by the Trustee on cash held
by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust, and (3) the sale of Securities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any advance remains outstanding
for more than forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee shall ordinarily sell
Securities to reimburse itself for such advance and any accrued interest
thereon. Such advances will be secured by a lien upon and a security interest in
the assets of the Trust in favor of the Trustee.


                                       73
<PAGE>

     In addition, as soon as practicable after notice of termination of the
Trust, the Trustee will distribute via the DTC and the DTC Participants to each
Beneficial Owner redeeming Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations
prior to the termination date specified in such notice, a portion of the
Securities and cash as described above. Otherwise, the Trustee will distribute
to each Beneficial Owner (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or
otherwise), as soon as practical after termination of the Trust, such Beneficial
Owner's pro rata share in cash of the net asset value of the Trust.

     All distributions are made by the Trustee through the DTC and the DTC
Participants to Beneficial Owners as recorded on the book-entry system of the
DTC and the DTC Participants.

     The settlement date for the creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit
size aggregations or the purchase of Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market
must occur on or prior to the Record Date in order for such creator or purchaser
to receive any distributions made by the Trust on the next Dividend Payment
Date. If the settlement date for such creation or a secondary market purchase
occurs after the Record Date, the distribution will be made to the prior
security holder or Beneficial Owner as of such Record Date.

Statements to Beneficial Owners; Annual Reports

     With each distribution, the Trustee will furnish for distribution to
Beneficial Owners (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System") a statement setting
forth the amount being distributed expressed as a dollar amount per Nasdaq-100
Share.

     Promptly after the end of each fiscal year, the Trustee will furnish to the
DTC Participants, for distribution to each person who was a Beneficial Owner of
Nasdaq-100 Shares at the end of such fiscal year, an annual report of the Trust
containing financial statements audited by independent accountants of nationally
recognized standing and such other information as may be required by applicable
laws, rules, and regulations.

Rights of Beneficial Owners

     Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations (i.e., 50,000
Nasdaq-100 Shares) may be tendered to the Trustee for redemption. Beneficial
Owners may sell Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market, but must accumulate
enough Nasdaq-100 Shares (i.e., 50,000 shares) to constitute a full Creation
Unit in order to redeem through the Trust. The death or incapacity of any
Beneficial Owner will not operate to terminate the Trust nor entitle such
Beneficial Owner's legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to
take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the
Trust. By its purchase of a Nasdaq-100 Share, each Beneficial Owner


                                       74
<PAGE>

expressly waives any right he or she may have under law to require the Trustee
at any time to account, in any manner other than as expressly provided in the
Trust Agreement, for the Securities or moneys from time to time received, held,
and applied by the Trustee under the Trust.

     Beneficial Owners shall not (a) have the right to vote concerning the
Trust, except with respect to termination and as otherwise expressly set forth
in the Trust Agreement, (b) in any manner control the operation and management
of the Trust or (c) be liable to any other person by reason of any action taken
by the Sponsor or the Trustee. The Trustee has the right to vote all of the
voting securities in the Trust. The Trustee votes the voting securities of each
issuer in the same proportionate relationship as all other shares of each such
issuer are voted to the extent permissible and, if not permitted, abstains from
voting.

Amendment

     The Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Trustee and the
Sponsor without the consent of any Beneficial Owners (a) to cure any ambiguity
or to correct or supplement any provision thereof which may be defective or
inconsistent or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions
arising thereunder as will not adversely affect the interests of Beneficial
Owners; (b) to change any provision thereof as may be required by the
Commission; (c) to add or change any provision as may be necessary or advisable
for the continuing qualification of the Trust as a "regulated investment
company" under the Code; (d) to add or change any provision thereof as may be
necessary or advisable in the event that NSCC or the DTC is unable or unwilling
to continue to perform its functions as set forth therein; (e) to add or change
any provision thereof to conform the adjustments to the Portfolio and the
Portfolio Deposit to changes, if any, made by Nasdaq in its method of
determining the Index; (f) to add or change any provision thereof as may be
necessary to implement a dividend reinvestment plan or service; (g) to make
changes to the Transaction Fee and to other amounts charged in connection with
creations and redemptions of Nasdaq-100 Shares within the original parameters
set forth in the Trust Agreement; and (h) to make changes to the level of net
dividends below which a dividend distribution will not be paid in a given
quarter and will instead be rolled into the next Accumulation Period.

     The Trust Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Sponsor
and the Trustee with the consent of the Beneficial Owners of 51% of the
outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares to add provisions to or change or eliminate any of
the provisions of the Trust Agreement or to modify the rights of Beneficial
Owners; provided, however, that the Trust Agreement may not be amended without
the consent of the Beneficial Owners of all outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares if
such amendment would (1) permit, except in accordance


                                       75
<PAGE>

with the terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement, the acquisition of any
securities other than those acquired in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Trust Agreement; (2) reduce the interest of any Beneficial Owner in the
Trust; or (3) reduce the percentage of Beneficial Owners required to consent to
any such amendment.

     Promptly after the execution of any such amendment, the Trustee shall
receive from the DTC, pursuant to the terms of the Depository Agreement, a list
of all DTC Participants holding Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Trustee shall inquire of
each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners for whom such
DTC Participant holds Nasdaq-100 Shares, and provide each such DTC Participant
with sufficient copies of a written notice of the substance of such amendment
for transmittal by each such DTC Participant to such Beneficial Owners.

Termination

     The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor has the discretionary right
to direct the Trustee to terminate the Trust if at any time the net asset value
of the Trust is less than $350,000,000, as such dollar amount shall be adjusted
for inflation in accordance with the CPI-U, such adjustment to take effect at
the end of the fourth year following the Initial Date of Deposit and at the end
of each year thereafter and to be made so as to reflect the percentage increase
in consumer prices as set forth in the CPI-U for the twelve-month period ending
in the last month of the preceding fiscal year.

     The Trust will also terminate in the event that Nasdaq-100 Shares are
delisted from Nasdaq and are not subsequently relisted on a national securities
exchange or a quotation medium operated by a national securities association.
Nasdaq will consider the suspension of trading in or the delisting of Nasdaq-100
Shares as discussed above.

     The Trust may also be terminated (a) by the agreement of the Beneficial
Owners of 66 2/3% of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares; (b) if the DTC is unable or
unwilling to continue to perform its functions as set forth under the Trust
Agreement and a suitable replacement is unavailable; (c) if NSCC no longer
provides clearance services with respect to Nasdaq-100 Shares and a suitable
replacement is unavailable, or if the Trustee is no longer a participant in NSCC
or any successor to NSCC providing clearance services; (d) if Nasdaq ceases
publishing the Index; and (e) if the License Agreement is terminated. The
License Agreement has been renewed until March 10, 2009. The Trust will also
terminate by its terms on the Mandatory Termination Date.

     If either the Sponsor or the Trustee shall resign or be removed and a
successor is not appointed, the Trust will terminate. The dissolution of the
Sponsor or its ceasing to exist as a legal entity for any cause whatsoever,


                                       76
<PAGE>

however, will not cause the termination of the Trust Agreement or the Trust
unless the Trustee deems termination to be in the best interests of Beneficial
Owners.

     Prior written notice of the termination of the Trust will be given at least
twenty (20) days prior to termination of the Trust to all Beneficial Owners in
the manner described above. The notice will set forth the date on which the
Trust will be terminated (the "Termination Date"), the period during which the
assets of the Trust will be liquidated, the date on which Beneficial Owners of
Nasdaq-100 Shares (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or otherwise) will
receive in cash the net asset value of the Nasdaq-100 Shares held, and the date
determined by the Trustee upon which the books of the Trust shall be closed.
Such notice shall further state that, as of the date thereof and thereafter,
neither requests to create additional Creation Units nor Portfolio Deposits will
be accepted, and that, as of the date thereof and thereafter, the portfolio of
Securities delivered upon redemption shall be essentially identical in
composition and weighting to the Securities held in the Trust as of such date
rather than the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit as in effect on the
date the request for redemption is deemed received. Beneficial Owners of
Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations may, in advance of the
Termination Date, redeem in kind directly from the Trust.

     Within a reasonable period of time after the Termination Date the Trustee
shall, subject to any applicable provisions of law, use its best efforts to sell
all of the Securities not already distributed to redeeming Beneficial Owners of
Creation Units. The Trustee shall not be liable for or responsible in any way
for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any such sale or sales. The
Trustee may suspend such sales upon the occurrence of unusual or unforeseen
circumstances, including but not limited to a suspension in trading of a
Security, the closing or restriction of trading, the outbreak of hostilities, or
the collapse of the economy. Upon receipt of proceeds from the sale of the last
Security, the Trustee shall deduct therefrom its fees and all other expenses.
The remaining amount shall be transmitted to the DTC for distribution via the
DTC Participants, together with a final statement setting forth the computation
of the gross amount distributed. Nasdaq-100 Shares not redeemed prior to
termination of the Trust will be redeemed in cash at net asset value based on
the proceeds of the sale of the Securities. Such redemptions in cash at net
asset value shall be available to all Beneficial Owners, with no minimum
aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares required.

                                    SPONSOR

     The Sponsor of the Trust is Nasdaq Global Funds, Inc. (formerly, Nasdaq
Financial Products Services, Inc.), a Delaware corporation incorporated on
August 7, 1998 with offices c/o The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., 9513 Key


                                       77
<PAGE>

West Avenue, Rockville, MD 20850. The Sponsor's Internal Revenue Service
Employer Identification Number is 52-2115391. Nasdaq owns all of the Sponsor's
outstanding shares of common stock. Nasdaq is a "control person" of the Sponsor
as such term is defined in the Securities Act.

     The Sponsor, at its own expense, may from time to time provide additional
promotional incentives to brokers who sell Nasdaq-100 Shares to the public. In
certain instances, these incentives may be provided only to those brokers who
meet certain threshold requirements for participation in a given incentive
program, such as selling a significant number of Nasdaq-100 Shares within a
specified time period.

     If at any time the Sponsor shall fail to undertake or perform or become
incapable of undertaking or performing any of the duties which by the terms of
the Trust Agreement are required of it to be undertaken or performed, or shall
resign, or shall become bankrupt or its affairs shall be taken over by public
authorities, the Trustee may appoint a successor Sponsor as shall be
satisfactory to the Trustee, agree to act as Sponsor itself, or may terminate
the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust. Notice of the resignation or
removal of the Sponsor and the appointment of a successor shall be mailed by the
Trustee to the DTC and the DTC Participants for distribution to Beneficial
Owners. Upon a successor Sponsor's execution of a written acceptance of such
appointment as Sponsor of the Trust, such successor Sponsor shall become vested
with all of the rights, powers, duties, and obligations of the original Sponsor.
Any successor Sponsor may be compensated at rates deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable.

     The Sponsor may resign by executing and delivering to the Trustee an
instrument of resignation. Such resignation shall become effective upon the
appointment of a successor Sponsor and the acceptance of such appointment by the
successor Sponsor, unless the Trustee either agrees to act as Sponsor or
terminates the Trust Agreement and liquidates the Trust, which the Trustee shall
do if no successor Sponsor is appointed. The dissolution of the Sponsor or its
ceasing to exist as a legal entity for any reason whatsoever will not cause the
termination of the Trust Agreement or the Trust unless the Trustee deems
termination to be in the best interests of the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100
Shares.

     The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor is not liable to the Trustee,
the Trust, or to the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares for taking any
action or for refraining from taking any action made in good faith or for errors
in judgment, but is liable only for its own gross negligence, bad faith, wilful
misconduct, or wilful malfeasance in the performance of its duties or its
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement. The
Sponsor is not liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by the Trust by reason of the sale of any


                                       78
<PAGE>

Securities of the Trust. The Trust Agreement further provides that the Sponsor
and its directors, subsidiaries, shareholders, officers, employees, and
affiliates under common control with the Sponsor (each a "Sponsor Indemnified
Party") shall be indemnified from the assets of the Trust and held harmless
against any loss, liability, or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad
faith, wilful misconduct, or wilful malfeasance on the part of any Sponsor
Indemnified Party in the performance of its duties or reckless disregard of its
obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement, including the payment of the
costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of defending against any claim or
liability.

                                    TRUSTEE

     The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a corporation organized under the laws
of the State of New York with trust powers. The Trustee has an office at 2
Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11217 and its Internal Revenue Service
Employer Identification Number is 135-160382. The Trustee is subject to
supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New York State Banking Department.

     Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may resign and be discharged of the
Trust created by the Trust Agreement by executing a notice of resignation in
writing and filing such notice with the Sponsor and mailing a copy of the notice
of resignation to all DTC Participants that are reflected on the records of the
DTC as owning Nasdaq-100 Shares, for distribution to Beneficial Owners as
provided above (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System") not less than sixty
(60) days before the date such resignation is to take effect. Such resignation
will become effective upon the appointment of and the acceptance of the Trust by
a successor Trustee or, if no successor is appointed within sixty (60) days
after the date such notice of resignation is given, the Trust shall terminate
(see "Administration of the Trust--Termination"). The Sponsor, upon receiving
notice of such resignation, is obligated to use its best efforts to appoint a
successor Trustee promptly.

     In case the Trustee becomes incapable of acting as such or is adjudged
bankrupt or is taken over by any public authority, the Sponsor may discharge the
Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement.
Notice of such discharge and appointment shall be mailed by the Sponsor to the
DTC and the DTC Participants for distribution to Beneficial Owners. Upon a
successor Trustee's execution of a written acceptance of an appointment as
Trustee for the Trust, such successor Trustee will become vested with all the
rights, powers, duties, and obligations of the original Trustee. A successor
Trustee is required to be a bank, trust company, corporation, or national
banking association organized and doing business


                                       79

under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, to be authorized under
such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, and to have at all times an
aggregate capital, surplus, and undivided profit of not less than $50,000,000.

     Beneficial Owners of 51% of the then outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares may at
any time remove the Trustee by written instrument(s) delivered to the Trustee
and the Sponsor. The Sponsor shall thereupon use its best efforts to appoint a
successor Trustee in the manner specified above and in the Trust Agreement.

     The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee is not liable for any action
taken in reasonable reliance on properly executed documents or for the
disposition of moneys or Securities or for the evaluations required to be made
thereunder, except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith, wilful
malfeasance, wilful misconduct, or reckless disregard of its duties and
obligations, nor is the Trustee liable or responsible in any way for
depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any
Securities in the Trust. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act, the
Trustee may act and is not liable for any such action taken by it in good faith.
The Trustee is not personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges
imposed upon or in respect of the Securities or upon the interest thereon or
upon it as Trustee or upon or in respect of the Trust which the Trustee may be
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
Trustee. The Trustee and its directors, subsidiaries, shareholders, officers,
employees, and affiliates under common control with the Trustee (each a "Trustee
Indemnified Party") will be indemnified from the assets of the Trust and held
harmless against any loss, liability, or expense incurred without gross
negligence, bad faith, wilful misconduct, wilful malfeasance on the part of such
Trustee Indemnified Party, or reckless disregard of its duties and obligations,
arising out of, or in connection with its acceptance or administration of the
Trust, including the costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of defending
against any claim or liability.

                                CODE OF ETHICS

     The Trust and the Sponsor have adopted a code of ethics regarding personal
securities transactions by their respective employees. Subject to certain
conditions and standards, the code permits employees to invest in the Nasdaq-100
Shares for their own accounts. The code is designed to prevent fraud, deception
and misconduct against the Trust and to provide reasonable standards of conduct.
The code is on file with the Commission and you may obtain a copy by visiting
the Commission at the address listed on the back cover of this prospectus. The
code is also available on the EDGAR Database on the Commission's Internet site

                 INFORMATION AND COMPARISON RELATING TO TRUST,
                   SECONDARY MARKET TRADING, NET ASSET SIZE,
                         PERFORMANCE, AND TAX TREATMENT

     Information regarding various aspects of the Trust, including the net asset
size thereof, as well as the secondary market trading, the performance, and the
tax treatment of Nasdaq-100 Shares, may be included from time to time in
advertisements, sales literature, and other communications as well as in reports
to current or prospective Beneficial Owners. Any such performance-related
information will reflect only past performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares, and no
guarantees can be made of future results.


                                       81

     Information may be provided to prospective investors to help such investors
assess their specific investment goals and to aid in their understanding of
various financial strategies. Such information may present current economic and
political trends and conditions and may describe general principles of investing
such as asset allocation, diversification, and risk tolerance, as well as
specific investment techniques such as indexing and hedging. In addition,
information may be presented to prospective or current Beneficial Owners
regarding the purchase of Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market, such as
margin requirements, types of orders that may be entered, and information
concerning short sales. Similarly, market data symbols, trading fractions, other
trading information, and the CUSIP number relating to Nasdaq-100 Shares may be
included in such information. Comparisons with other investment vehicles, such
as mutual funds, may be made with respect to the application of such
requirements, costs of fund management and administration, costs and advantages
of intraday trading, and rules applicable to short sales.

     Information regarding the Trust's net asset size may be stated in
communications to prospective or current Beneficial Owners for one or more time
periods, including annual, year-to-date, or daily periods. Such information may
also be expressed in terms of the total number of Nasdaq-100 Shares outstanding
as of one or more time periods. Factors integral to the size of the Trust's net
assets, such as creation volume and activity, may also be discussed and may be
specified from time to time or with respect to various periods of time.
Comparisons of such information during various periods may also be made and may
be expressed by means of percentages.

     Information may be provided to investors regarding the ability to engage in
short sales of Nasdaq-100 Shares, including reference to any applicable
exemption from the "tick test" provision of the Commission's "short sale rule"
(Rule 10a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), to permit short sales on
"minus" or "zero-minus" ticks. Selling short refers to the sale of securities
which the seller does not own, but which the seller arranges to borrow prior
to effecting the sale. Institutional investors may be advised that lending their
Nasdaq-100 Shares to short sellers may generate stock loan credits which may
supplement the return they can earn from an investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares.
These stock loan credits may provide a useful source of additional income for
certain institutional investors who can arrange to lend Nasdaq-100 Shares.
Potential short sellers may be advised that a short rebate (functionally
equivalent to partial use of proceeds of the short sale) may reduce their cost
of selling short.

     Information may be provided to investors regarding capital gains
distributions by the Trust, including historical information relating to such
distributions. Comparisons between the Trust and other investment vehicles


                                       82
<PAGE>

such as mutual funds may be made regarding such capital gains distributions, as
well as relative tax efficiencies between the Trust and such other investment
vehicles (e.g., realization of capital gains or losses to the Trust and to such
other investment vehicles in connection with redemption of their respective
securities). (See "Tax Status of the Trust" for discussion of tax consequences
to Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in connection with the sale or
redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares.) Based on projected differences between
Nasdaq-100 Shares and conventional mutual funds with regard to capital gains
distributions, projections may be made regarding comparative capital gains
distributions and tax rates for taxable investors holding Nasdaq-100 Shares over
a long period of time. Comparisons may also be provided regarding the probable
tax impact resulting from rebalancing of the Trust portfolio (see "The
Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio") and adjustments to the portfolio of an
actively managed investment vehicle.

     Specifically, information may be provided to prospective or current
investors comparing and contrasting the tax efficiencies of conventional mutual
funds with Nasdaq-100 Shares. Both conventional mutual funds and the Trust may
be required to recognize capital gains incurred as a result of adjustments to
the composition and weighting of the Index and therefore to their respective
portfolios. From a tax perspective, however, a significant difference between a
conventional mutual fund and the Trust is the process by which their shares are
redeemed. In cases where a conventional mutual fund experiences redemptions in
excess of subscriptions ("net redemptions") and has insufficient cash available
to fund such net redemptions, such fund may have to sell stocks held in its
portfolio to raise and pay cash to redeeming shareholders. A mutual fund will
generally experience a taxable gain or loss when it sells such portfolio stocks
in order to pay cash to redeeming fund shareholders. In contrast, the redemption
mechanism for Nasdaq-100 Shares does not ordinarily involve selling the
Securities held by the Trust in the event of a redemption. Instead, the Trust
delivers an actual portfolio of securities in an "in-kind" exchange to any
person redeeming Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations (i.e.,
50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares per Creation Unit). While this "in-kind" exchange is a
taxable transaction to the redeeming entity (usually a broker/dealer) making the
exchange, it generally does not constitute a taxable transaction at the Trust
level and, consequently, there is no realization of taxable gain or loss by the
Trust with respect to such "in-kind" exchanges. In a period of market
appreciation of the Index and, consequently, appreciation of Nasdaq-100 Shares,
this "in-kind" redemption mechanism has the effect of eliminating the
recognition and distribution of those net unrealized gains at the Trust level.
Investors should note that although the same result would occur for conventional
mutual funds utilizing an "in-kind" redemption mechanism, the opportunities to
redeem fund shares by delivering portfolio stocks "in-kind" are limited in most
mutual funds.

     Investors may be informed that, while no unequivocal statement can be made
as to the net tax impact on a conventional mutual fund resulting from the
purchases and sales of its portfolio stocks over a period of time, conventional
funds that have accumulated substantial unrealized capital gains, if they
experience net redemptions and do not have sufficient available cash, may be
required to make taxable capital gains distributions that are generated by
changes in such fund's portfolio. In contrast, the "in-kind" redemption
mechanism of Nasdaq-100 Shares may make them more tax efficient investments
under most circumstances than comparable conventional mutual fund shares. As
discussed above, this "in-kind" redemption feature of the Trust tends to lower
the amount of annual net capital gains distributions to Nasdaq-100 Shareholders
as compared to their conventional mutual fund counterparts. Since shareholders
are generally required to pay income tax on capital gains distributions, the
smaller the amount of such distributions, the less taxes that are payable
currently. To the extent that the Trust is not required to recognize capital
gains, the Nasdaq-100 Shareholder is able, in effect, to defer tax on such gains
until he sells or otherwise disposes of his shares, or the Trust terminates. If
such holder retains his shares until his death, under current law the tax basis
of such shares would be adjusted to their then fair market value.

     Information regarding the secondary market trading activity of Nasdaq-100
Shares also may be presented over one or more stated time periods, such as for
daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual periods. Nasdaq-100 Share secondary market
trading volume information may be compared with similar information relating to
other issues trading on Nasdaq during the same reporting period. Average daily
secondary market trading volume of Nasdaq-100 Shares may also be reported from
time to time. Comparisons of such information during various periods may also be
made, and may be expressed by means of percentages.

     Information may also be provided in communications to prospective investors
or current Beneficial Owners comparing and contrasting the relative advantages
of investing in Nasdaq-100 Shares as compared to other investment vehicles, such
as mutual funds, both on an individual and a group basis (e.g., stock index
mutual funds). Such information may include comparisons of costs and expense
ratios, expressed either in dollars or basis points, stock lending activities,
permitted investments and hedging activities (e.g., engaging in options or
futures transactions), and portfolio turnover data and analyses. In addition,
such information may quote, reprint, or include portions of financial,
scholarly, or business publications or periodicals, including model allocation
schedules or portfolios, as the foregoing relate to the comparison of Nasdaq-100
Shares to other investment vehicles, current economic, financial and political
conditions, investment philosophy or techniques, or the desirability of owning
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     In addition, information on the performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares on the
basis of changes in price per Nasdaq-100 Share with or without reinvesting all
dividends, if any, and/or any distributions of capital in additional Nasdaq-100
Shares may be included from time to time in such information. Average annualized
performance may be stated for various periods. Total return figures may also be
stated for a period from the Initial Date of Deposit, a date at least twelve
months prior to the end of the reporting period or for annual periods for the
life of the Trust. Total return measures the percentage growth in the total
dollar value of an investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares (reflecting dividends, if
any, and capital appreciation but without provision for any income taxes
payable).

     Information on the Index contained in this Prospectus, as updated from time
to time, may also be included from time to time in such material. The
performance of the Trust, of the Index (provided information is also given
reflecting the performance of the Trust in comparison to the Index) or both may
also be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in market
surveys such as SEI Fund Evaluation Survey (a leading database of tax-exempt
funds) or mutual funds such as those reported by Lipper Analytical Services
Inc., Money Magazine Fund Watch, Wiesenberger Investment Companies Service,
Morningstar Incorporated, and Value Line Investment Survey, each of which
measures performance following their own specific and well-defined calculation
measures, or of the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock
Exchange Composite Index, the Nasdaq Composite Index (indices of stocks traded
on the New York and American Stock Exchanges and The Nasdaq Stock Market,
respectively), the S&P 500 Index[RegTM] (a broad-based index of 500 publicly
traded companies), the S&P MidCap 400 Index(RegTM) (a broad-based index of 400
publicly traded middle capitalization companies), the Dow Jones Industrial
Average(SM) (an index currently comprising 30 publicly traded large
capitalization companies), or similar domestic or foreign measurement standards
during the same period of time. In addition to all other sources of comparative
information, comparative performance figures published by other funds or money
managers may be included from time to time. Information may also be included
regarding the aggregate amount of assets committed to index investing generally
by various types of investors, such as pension funds and other institutional
investors, which currently exceeds $300 billion.

     Information on the relative price performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
relation to other securities and/or indices may be represented in the form of
"correlation." Correlation is a standard measure of the degree of linear
association between two price series, and ranges from minus one hundred percent
(-100%) (i.e., perfect negative linear association) to positive one hundred
percent (+100%) (i.e., perfect positive linear association).

     One important difference between Nasdaq-100 Shares and conventional mutual
fund shares is that Nasdaq-100 Shares are available for purchase or sale on an
intraday basis on Nasdaq. An investor who buys shares in a conventional mutual
fund will usually buy or sell shares at a price at or related to the closing net
asset value per share, as determined by the fund. In contrast, Nasdaq-100 Shares
are not offered for purchase or redeemed for cash at a fixed relationship to
closing NAV. The tables below illustrate the distribution relationships of daily
pricing data for Nasdaq-100 Shares, NAV and the Nasdaq-100 Index for the 2003
calendar year. These tables may help investors compare the trading costs and
intraday trading risks of Nasdaq-100 Shares to funds sold and redeemed at prices
related to closing NAV.

     Investors who purchase or sell Nasdaq-100 Shares may wish to evaluate the
volatility of the price of Nasdaq-100 Shares during the trading day. To assist
investors in making such an evaluation, the Daily Percentage Price Range table
illustrates the volatility of price movements for both Nasdaq-100 Shares and the
Nasdaq-100 Index on a daily basis. Investors who purchase or sell Nasdaq-100
Shares may also wish to evaluate the opportunity to buy or sell on an intraday
basis versus the assurance of a transaction at or related to closing NAV. To
assist investors in making this comparison, the High and Low Price versus
Closing Value table illustrates the possibility of buying or selling Nasdaq-100
Shares at prices less or more favorable than closing NAV.

     Investors may wish to evaluate the potential of Nasdaq-100 Shares to
approximate the value of the assets in the Trust as a basis of valuation of the
shares. The Closing Price versus NAV table illustrates the closing value of
Nasdaq-100 Shares in relation to the underlying value of the assets in the Trust
on a daily basis. Additionally, the NAV versus Nasdaq-100 Index table shows the
difference between the underlying value of assets in the Trust and the
Nasdaq-100 Index based on month-end values.

     Finally, investors may wish to consider the average bid/asked spread on
Nasdaq-100 Shares, as illustrated in the Bid/Asked Spread table, and add any
commissions charged by a broker to determine the direct costs of trading
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     The information provided in the following tables with respect to the
Nasdaq-100 Shares (including price ranges, relationship of prices to closing
NAV, and bid/asked spreads) may vary materially over time. There is some
evidence, for example, that the bid/asked spread will widen in more volatile
markets and narrow when markets are less volatile.

     The price range of Nasdaq-100 Shares for the 2004 calendar year was from
$32.00 to $40.68.

     Information relating to the relative price performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares
may be compared against a wide variety of investment categories and asset
classes, including common stocks, small capitalization stocks, long and
intermediate-term corporate and government bonds, Treasury bills, the rate of
inflation in the United States (based on the Consumer Price Index ("CPI")) and
combinations of various capital markets. Historical returns of these and other
capital markets in the United States may be provided by independent statistical
studies and sources, such as those provided by Ibbotson Associates of Chicago,
Illinois. The performance of these capital markets is based on the returns of
different indices. Information may be presented using the performance of these
and other capital markets to demonstrate general investment strategies. For
example, the performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares may be compared to the performance
of selected asset classes such as short-term U.S. Treasury bills, long-term U.S.
Treasury bonds, long-term corporate bonds, mid-capitalization stocks, foreign
stocks, and small capitalization stocks and may also be measured against the
rate of inflation as set forth in well-known indices (such as the CPI).
Performance comparisons may also include the value of a hypothetical investment
in any of these capital markets. Performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares may also be
compared to that of other indices or compilations that may be developed and made
available to the investing public in the future. Of course, such comparisons
will only reflect past performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares and the investment
categories, indices, or compilations chosen, and no guarantees can be made of
future results regarding the performance of either Nasdaq-100 Shares or the
asset classes chosen for such comparisons.
