                                   HIGHLIGHTS

Nasdaq-100 Shares(SM) are Ownership Interests in the Nasdaq-100 Trust

     The Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust
that issues securities called Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock (also referred to
in this Prospectus as "Nasdaq-100 Shares"). The Trust is a unit investment
trust organized under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust is governed
by a trust agreement (the "Trust Agreement") between The Bank of New York, a
corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York with trust powers
(the "Trustee"), and Nasdaq Financial Products Services, Inc. (the "Sponsor"),
dated and executed as of March 4, 1999, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the
Trust Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2001. Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock
represents undivided ownership interests in the portfolio of stocks held by the
Trust. The Trust holds all of the common stocks of the Nasdaq-100 Index (the
"Index").

Nasdaq-100 Shares Should Generally Correspond to the Value of the Underlying
Nasdaq-100 Index

     The investment objective of the Trust is to provide investment results
that generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Index (the
component securities of the Index are sometimes referred to herein as "Index
Securities"). There can be no assurance that this investment objective will be
met fully.

     The Trust holds the Portfolio and cash and is not actively managed by
traditional methods, which typically involve effecting changes in the Portfolio
on the basis of judgments made relating to economic, financial and market
considerations. To maintain the correspondence between the composition and
weights of the securities in the Trust (the "Securities") and the stocks in the
Nasdaq-100 Index, the Trustee adjusts the Securities from time to time to
conform to periodic changes in the identity and/or relative weights of
Nasdaq-100 Index stocks. The composition and weighting of the securities
portion of a Portfolio Deposit are also adjusted to conform to changes in the
Index. Any change in the identity or weighting of an Index Security will result
in a corresponding adjustment to the prescribed Portfolio Deposit generally
effective on the Business Day (a "Business Day" being any day that The Nasdaq
Stock Market is open for business) on which the change to the Index takes
effect or shortly thereafter. Changes to the Index are made after the close of
the market (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit").

     The value of the Nasdaq-100 Shares will fluctuate in relation to changes
in the value of the Trust's portfolio of securities. However, at any point in


                                       3
<PAGE>

time, the market price of each individual Nasdaq-100 Share may not be identical
to the net asset value ("NAV") of such share. Historically, these two
valuations have been very close.

     The current value of the Nasdaq-100 Index will ordinarily continue to be
reported even when trading is interrupted in its component stocks. In that
event, the reported Index level will be based on the current market price of
those stocks still being traded (if any) and the last reported prices for those
stocks that are not currently trading. As a result, reported Index levels may
at times be based on noncurrent price information with respect to some or even
all of the stocks in the Nasdaq-100 Index.

Nasdaq-100 Shares Trade on the American Stock Exchange

     Nasdaq-100 Shares are listed for trading on the Amex. Nasdaq-100 Shares
are bought and sold in the secondary market like ordinary shares of stock at
any time during the trading day. Nasdaq-100 Shares generally trade in round
lots of 100 shares, but can be traded in odd lots of as little as one share.
Trading of Nasdaq-100 Shares on the Amex may be halted under the circumstances
described in the paragraphs below relating to the risks of investing in
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

The Nasdaq-100 Trust Issues and Redeems Nasdaq-100 Shares in Multiples of
50,000 Shares Called "Creation Units"


     The Trust issues Nasdaq-100 Shares only in multiples of 50,000 shares,
which are referred to as "Creation Units." Creation Units are issued by the
Trust to anyone who, after placing a creation order with ALPS Distributors,
Inc. (the "Distributor"), deposits with The Bank of New York, the "Trustee" of
the Trust, a specified portfolio of Nasdaq-100 Index securities, as well as a
cash payment, if any, generally equal to accumulated dividends of the
securities (net of expenses) up to the time of deposit.


     Nasdaq-100 Shares are not individually redeemable, except upon termination
of the Trust. Nasdaq-100 Shares can be redeemed only by tendering to the Trust
50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares or multiples thereof. Upon redemption, the redeeming
holder will receive a portfolio of Nasdaq-100 Index securities based on the net
asset value of the Trust plus, in some cases, a cash payment. The cash payment
amount is generally equal to the cash amount determined for creations of
Nasdaq-100 Shares and, likewise, may be paid by either the redeeming holder or
the Trust, depending on the values of the dividends received, Trust expenses
and the adjustment amount.


                                       4

Creation Orders Must be Placed With the Distributor


     All orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares must be placed with the Distributor
(see "The Trust--Procedures for Creation of Creation Units"). To be eligible to
place orders with the Distributor to create Creation Unit size aggregations of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, an entity or person either must be (1) a "Participating
Party," as hereinafter defined, or (2) a Depository Trust Company Participant
(see "Book-Entry Ownership Only of Nasdaq-100 Shares"), and in each case must
have executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement. The term "Participating Party"
means a broker-dealer or other participant in the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process,
through the Continuous Net Settlement ("CNS") System of the National Securities
Clearing Corporation ("NSCC"), a clearing agency that is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission").(3) Upon acceptance of an
order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Distributor will transmit such order to
the Trustee and instruct the Trustee to initiate the book-entry movement of the
appropriate number of Nasdaq-100 Shares to the account of the entity placing the
order. Payment for orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares will be made by deposits
with the Trustee of a portfolio of securities that is substantially similar in
composition and weighting to the Index Securities (see "The Trust--Creation of
Creation Units"), together, in certain cases, with a cash payment in an amount
which shall be equal to the Income Net of Expense Amount (as hereinafter
defined), plus or minus, as the case may be, the Balancing Amount (as
hereinafter defined). The "Income Net of Expense Amount" is an amount equal, on
a per Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on all the Securities with
ex-dividend dates within the period beginning on the most recent ex-dividend
date for Nasdaq-100 Shares (the third Friday in each of March, June, September,
and December, see "Distributions") through and including the current Business
Day (the "Accumulation Period") as if all of the Securities had been held for
such period, net of accrued expenses and liabilities for such period not
previously deducted (including, without limitation, (x) taxes or other
governmental charges against the Trust not previously deducted, if any, and (y)
accrued fees of the Trustee and other expenses of the Trust (including legal and
auditing expenses) and other expenses not previously deducted (see "Expenses of
the


-----------------------------
(3)   As of December 31, 2003, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
      Inc. (the "NASD") beneficially owned approximately 3.69% of the issued and
      outstanding shares of common stock of The Depository Trust & Clearing
      Corporation ("DTCC"), the parent company of NSCC and the Depository, and
      the NASD owned 10,000 shares of Series B preferred stock of DTCC, which
      entitles the NASD to elect one director of DTCC. The NASD currently has
      majority voting control of Nasdaq.


                                       5
<PAGE>

"Balancing Amount" serves the function of compensating for any differences
between (1) the value of the portfolio of securities deposited with the Trustee
in connection with a creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares, together with the Income
Net of Expense Amount, and (2) the net asset value of the Trust on a per
Creation Unit basis (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit"
for a further description thereof).

     The Income Net of Expense Amount and the Balancing Amount are collectively
referred to herein as the "Cash Component" and the deposit of such a portfolio
of securities and the Cash Component are collectively referred to herein as a
"Portfolio Deposit." In connection with an order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares on
any given day, the Cash Component of the Portfolio Deposit may be payable
either by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust to the creator of Nasdaq-100
Shares or by the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares to the Trustee on behalf of the
Trust, depending upon the respective amounts of the Income Net of Expense
Amount and the Balancing Amount.

     An entity or person placing creation orders with the Distributor must
either (i) initiate instructions pertaining to Portfolio Deposits through the
CNS clearing processes of NSCC, as such processes have been enhanced to effect
creations and redemptions of Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100
Shares, such processes being referred to herein as the "Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process," or (ii) deposit Portfolio Deposits with the Trustee outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process (i.e., through the facilities of The Depository
Trust Company).

     The Distributor acts as underwriter of Nasdaq-100 Shares on an agency
basis. The Distributor maintains records of the orders placed with it and the
confirmations of acceptance and furnishes to those placing such orders
confirmations of acceptance of the orders. The Distributor also is responsible
for delivering a prospectus to persons creating Nasdaq-100 Shares. The
Distributor also maintains a record of the delivery instructions in response to
orders and may provide certain other administrative services, such as those
related to state securities law compliance. The Distributor is a corporation
organized under the laws of the State of Colorado and is located at 370 17th
Street, Suite 3100, Denver, CO 80202. The Distributor is a registered
broker-dealer and a member of the NASD. The Sponsor pays the Distributor for
its services a flat annual fee. The Sponsor will not seek reimbursement for
such payment from the Trust without obtaining prior exemptive relief from the
Commission.

Bar Chart and Table

     The bar chart below entitled "Annual Total Returns for the Trust" and
table below entitled "Average Annual Total Returns (for periods ending December
31, 2003)" provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Trust by
showing the variability of the Trust's returns based on net assets and
comparing the Trust's performance to the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index.
Past performance (both before and after tax) is not necessarily an indication
of how the Trust will perform in the future.

     The after-tax returns presented below are calculated using highest
historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the
impact of state and local taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on
your specific tax situation and may differ from those shown below. After-tax
returns are not relevant to investors who hold Nasdaq-100 Shares through
tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement
accounts.

     The total returns in the bar chart below, as well as the total and
after-tax returns presented in the Table, do not reflect Transaction Fees
payable by those persons purchasing and redeeming Creation Units, nor brokerage
commissions incurred by those persons purchasing and selling Nasdaq-100 Shares
in the secondary market (see footnotes to the Table).

     This bar chart shows the performance of the Trust for each full calendar
year since its inception on March 4, 1999. During the period shown below
(January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2003), the highest quarterly return for
the Trust was 18.56% for the quarter ended March 30, 2000, and the lowest was
-36.18% for the quarter ended September 30, 2001.

     Future expense accruals will depend primarily on the level of the Trust's
net assets and the level of expenses. There is no guarantee that in the future
the Trust's ordinary operating expenses will not exceed 0.20% of the Trust's
daily net asset value. The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue its
reimbursement policy in the future.

     A transaction fee is payable to the Trustee in connection with each
creation and redemption of Creation Units made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process ("Transaction Fee") and is nonrefundable, regardless of the NAV of the
Trust.

     Until further notice is given as described below, the Transaction Fee
charged in connection with each creation of Creation Units through the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is (i) $500 per Participating Party per day for
creations of Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares where there
are also, in the same day, separate creations in any number, or redemptions in
an amount not equal to the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares created, of other
similar exchange traded funds based on the Index for which the Trustee or its
affiliate acts as trustee, fund administrator or in any similar capacity, (ii)
no fee per Participating Party where there is, in the same day, a redemption of
an equal number of shares of another similar exchange traded fund based on the
Index for which the Trustee or its affiliate acts as the trustee, fund
administrator or in any similar capacity, and (iii) in all other


                                       8
<PAGE>

cases $1,000 per Participating Party per day, regardless of the number of
Creation Units created on such day by such Participating Party. Likewise, until
further notice is given as described below, the Transaction Fee charged in
connection with the Redemption of Creation Units through the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process is (i) $500 per Participating Party per day for redemption of
Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares where there are also, in
the same day, separate redemptions in any number, or creations in an amount not
equal to the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares redeemed, or another similar exchange
traded fund based on the Index for which the Trustee or its affiliate acts as
trustee, fund administrator or in any similar capacity, (ii) no fee per
Participating Party where there is, in the same day, a creation of an equal
number of shares of another similar exchange traded fund based on the Index for
which the Trustee or its affiliate acts as the trustee, fund administrator or
in any similar capacity, and (iii) in all other cases $1,000 per Participating
Party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed on such day
by such Participating Party. This Transaction Fee may subsequently be changed
by the Trustee, with the consent of the Sponsor, but will not in any event
exceed 10/100 of one percent (10 basis points) of the value of a Creation Unit
at the time of creation or redemption, as the case may be (the "10 Basis Point
Limit"). No modification to, or reductions, discounts or waivers of, the
Transaction Fee charged in connection with the creation of Creation Units is
scheduled or currently contemplated by the Sponsor or the Trustee.

     For creations and redemptions outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, an
additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the applicable Transaction Fee
will be charged to the creator or redeemer. Under the current schedule,
therefore, the total fee charged in connection with the creation or redemption
of Creation Units outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process would be (i) $500 per
Participating Party per day for creations of Creation Unit size aggregations of
Nasdaq-100 Shares where there are also, in the same day, separate creations in
any number, or redemptions in an amount not equal to the number of Nasdaq-100
Shares created, of other similar exchange traded funds based on the Index for
which the Trustee or its affiliate acts as trustee, fund administrator or in
any similar capacity, (ii) no fee per Participating Party where there is, in
the same day, a redemption of an equal number of shares of another similar
exchange traded fund based on the Index for which the Trustee or its affiliate
acts as the trustee, fund administrator or in any similar capacity and (iii) in
all other cases $1,000 (the Transaction Fee for the creation or redemption of a
Creation Unit) plus an additional amount not to exceed $3,000 (3 times $1,000)
for a total of $4,000.

Expenses of the Trust

     The expenses of the Trust will be accrued daily and reflected in the net
asset value of the Trust. Until the Sponsor otherwise determines, the Sponsor
has undertaken that the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust will not
exceed 0.20% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust, and the
Sponsor will reimburse the Trust for expenses incurred by the Trust in excess
of such amount.

    (1) In addition, secondary market purchases and sale of Nasdaq-100 Shares
        are subject to ordinary brokerage commissions and charges.

    (2) The Trustee's annual fee ranges from 0.04% to 0.10%, based on the net
        asset value of the Trust. Ordinary operating expenses of the Trust do
        not include brokerage commissions incurred on the purchase or sale of
        Securities.

    (3) Marketing expenses include direct advertising in print and television
        media, and the cost of production of such advertising, consultant fees
        and prospectus printing expenses.

    (4) The amount represents less than 0.01%.

    (5) Until the Sponsor otherwise determines, the Sponsor has undertaken
        that the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust will not be permitted
        to exceed 0.20% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust.
        Gross expenses of the Trust for the year ending September 30, 2003,
        without regard to this undertaking, were also 0.20% of the net asset
        value of the Trust and, accordingly, as disclosed in footnote (2) to
        the financial highlights of the Trust, no expenses of the Trust were
        assumed by the Sponsor. The Sponsor may, in its sole discretion,
        discontinue its undertaking to limit ordinary operating expenses of the
        Trust or renew this undertaking for an additional period of time, and,
        if renewed, such 0.20% level may be changed and may exceed 0.20%. See
        "Expenses of the Trust."

     An investor does not pay any sales charges in connection with purchases or
reinvestment of distributions of Nasdaq-100 Shares or ordinarily any deferred
sales charge on the redemption (redemptions are only allowed in Creation Unit
sizes - i.e., 50,000 Shares of Nasdaq-100 Shares). Investors purchasing or
selling Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market would incur customary
brokerage commissions and charges.

     Transaction fees charged in connection with each creation or redemption of
Creation Units through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process range from $0 to $1,000
per Participating Party, depending on whether they are separate creations or
redemptions of Nasdaq-100 Shares or shares of other similar exchange traded
funds based on the Index.

Example of Expenses:

     An investor would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment,
assuming the estimated operating expense ratio cap of 0.20% set forth in
footnote (5) above for the year ending September 30, 2003, and assuming
estimated gross operating expenses thereafter remain at 0.20% of the net asset
value of the Trust and a 5% annual return on investment throughout the periods.

     Cumulative Expenses Paid for Period of:

<TABLE>

     The above example assumes the reinvestment of all dividends and
distributions and utilizes a 5% annual rate of return as mandated by Commission
regulations applicable to mutual funds. Although the Trust is a unit investment
trust rather than a mutual fund, this information is represented to permit a
comparison of fees. The example should not be considered a representation of
past or future expenses or annual rate of return; the actual expenses and
annual rate of return may be more or less than those assumed for purposes of
this example. Investors should also note that the presentation of a $1,000
investment is for illustration purposes only. Pursuant to an exemptive order
obtained from the Commission, the Trust may reimburse the Sponsor for certain
expenses relating to the printing and distribution of marketing materials
describing the Nasdaq-100 Shares and the Trust, reimbursement to the Sponsor
for annual licensing fees and federal and state annual registration fees for
the issuance of Nasdaq-100 Shares up to 0.20% (20 basis points) of the Trust's
total assets.

Book-Entry Ownership Only of Nasdaq-100 Shares

     The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, a limited purpose trust
company organized under the laws of the State of New York (referred to herein
as "DTC") or its nominee will be the record or registered owner of all


                                       11
<PAGE>

outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares. Beneficial ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares will
be shown on the records of the DTC or its participants. Certificates will not
be issued for Nasdaq-100 Shares, whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or
otherwise.

Distributions


     Distributions by the Trust are made quarterly to the extent that dividends
accumulated in respect of the Securities and other income, if any, received by
the Trust exceed Trust fees and expenses accrued during the quarterly
Accumulation Period which ends on the Business Day preceding each ex-dividend
date for Nasdaq-100 Shares. However, no net dividend distribution will be made
in any given quarter, and any net dividend amounts will be rolled into the next
Accumulation Period, if the aggregate net dividend distribution would be in an
amount less than 5/100 of one percent (0.05%) of the net asset value of the
Trust, unless the Trustee determines that such distribution is required to be
made in order to maintain the Trust's status as a regulated investment company
or to avoid the imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income.

     The expenses of the Trust may be as great as or in excess of the dividend
and other income to be received by the Trust during any quarter and, under such
circumstances, no quarterly net dividend distributions would be made.


     Any net capital gains recognized by the Trust in any taxable year are to
be distributed at least annually. The Trust may make additional distributions
after the end of the year in order to satisfy certain distribution requirements
imposed by the Code (as defined below). Although income distributions, if any,
are currently made on a quarterly basis, the Trustee reserves the right to vary
the frequency of distributions.

Federal Income Tax Considerations

     The Trust has elected tax treatment as a "regulated investment company"
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), and
distributes annually its entire investment company taxable income and capital
gain, if any. Distributions that are taxable as ordinary income to Beneficial
Owners generally are expected to constitute dividend income for federal income
tax purposes and to be eligible for the dividends-received deduction available
to many corporations to the extent of qualifying dividend income received by
the Trust. The quarterly distributions, if any, made by the Trust will be based
on the dividend performance of the Securities held during such quarterly
distribution period, net of Trust fees and expenses, rather than the actual
taxable income of the Trust. As a result, a portion of any such distributions
of the Trust may be treated as a return of capital or a capital gain dividend
for federal income tax


                                       12
<PAGE>

purposes or the Trust may be required to make additional distributions to
maintain its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of
income or excise taxes on undistributed income.

Termination of the Nasdaq-100 Trust

     The Trust has a specified lifetime term. The Trust will terminate by its
terms on the first to occur of: (i) March 4, 2124 or (ii) the date twenty (20)
years after the death of the last survivor of fifteen persons named in the
Trust Agreement, the oldest of whom was born in 1986 and the youngest of whom
was born in 1996 (the "Mandatory Termination Date").

Purchases of Nasdaq-100 Shares by Registered Investment Companies


     Purchases of Nasdaq-100 Shares by registered investment companies are
subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. The
Trust has applied for an order from the Commission that would permit registered
investment companies to invest in Nasdaq-100 Shares beyond these limits,
subject to certain conditions and terms stated in the order. One such condition
stated in the application is that registered investment companies relying on
the order must enter into a written agreement with the Trust. The Sponsor will
notify investors if, and when, the requested order is granted.


Risk Factors

     Investors can lose money by investing in Nasdaq-100 Shares. Investors
should carefully consider the risk factors described below together with all of
the other information included in this Prospectus before deciding to invest in
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     Investment in the Trust involves the risk that the value of the Securities
may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the
issuers of the Securities, the value of common stocks generally, and other
factors. The composition and weighting of the Index Securities and hence the
composition and weighting of the Securities held in the Trust also change from
time to time.

     The financial condition of the issuers of the Securities may become
impaired or the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate (either
of which may cause a decrease in the value of the Securities and thus in the
value of Nasdaq-100 Shares). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock
market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market
confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor
perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including
expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies,
inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or


                                       13
<PAGE>

regional political, economic, and banking crises. There can be no assurance
that the issuers of the Securities will pay dividends on outstanding shares of
common stock. Distributions on the Securities will generally depend upon the
declaration of dividends by the issuers of the Securities; the declaration of
such dividends generally depends upon various factors, including the financial
condition of the issuers and general economic conditions.

     The Trust is not actively managed by traditional methods, and therefore
the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not result in the elimination
of its securities from the Securities held by the Trust unless the Securities
of such issuer are removed from the Index.

     Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders
of preferred stocks and debt obligations of such issuer because common
stockholders, as owners of such issuer, have generally subordinate rights to
receive payments from such issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors
of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer.
Further, unlike debt securities which typically have a stated principal amount
payable at maturity (whose value, however, will be subject to market
fluctuations prior thereto), or preferred stocks which typically have a
liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory
redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor
a maturity. Common stock values are subject to market fluctuations as long as
the common stock remains outstanding. The value of the Securities may therefore
be expected to fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust.

     All of the Securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq National Market.
The existence of a liquid trading market for certain Securities may depend on
whether dealers will make a market in such Securities. There can be no
assurance that a market will be made for any of the Securities, that any market
for the Securities will be maintained, or that any such market will be or
remain liquid. The price at which the Securities may be sold and the value of
the Trust will be adversely affected if trading markets for the Securities are
limited or absent.

     An investment in the Trust should also be made with an understanding that
the Trust will not be able to replicate exactly the performance of the Index
because the total return generated by the Securities will be reduced by
transaction costs incurred in adjusting the actual balance of the Securities
and other Trust expenses, whereas such transaction costs and expenses are not
included in the calculation of the Index. It is also possible that for short
periods of time, the Trust may not fully replicate the performance of the Index
due to the temporary unavailability of certain Index Securities in the
secondary market or due to other extraordinary circumstances. Such events are
unlikely to continue for an extended period of time because the Trustee is
required to correct such imbalances by means of adjusting the composition


                                       14
<PAGE>

of the Securities. It is also possible that the composition of the Trust may
not exactly replicate the composition of the Index if the Trust has to adjust
its portfolio holdings in order to continue to qualify as a "regulated
investment company" under the Code.

     The time frames for delivery of Securities, cash, or Nasdaq-100 Shares in
connection with creation and redemption activity within the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process as set forth herein are based on NSCC's current "regular way"
settlement period of three (3) days during which NSCC is open for business
(each such day an "NSCC Business Day"). NSCC may, in the future, reduce such
"regular way" settlement period, in which case it is anticipated that there
would be a corresponding reduction or increase in settlement periods applicable
to Nasdaq-100 Share creations and redemptions.

     Historically, the portfolio of securities comprising the Index has paid
relatively low dividends when compared to the securities comprising other
broad-based stock indices. Distribution to Beneficial Owners is dependent on
the payment of dividends by issuers of the Securities.

     The Sponsor has currently undertaken to limit ordinary operating expenses
of the Trust to 0.20%. The Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, discontinue its
undertaking to limit ordinary operating expenses of the Trust. In such event,
the likelihood may increase that expenses of the Trust would exceed the
dividend and other income received by the Trust during each quarter. The Trust
will pay any such excess expenses with the proceeds realized from the sale of
Securities effected ordinarily whenever the Trustee determines that projected
annualized fees and expenses accrued on a daily basis exceed projected
annualized dividends and the Trust income accrued on a daily basis by more than
1/100 of one percent (0.01%) of the net asset value of the Trust.

     The net asset value of the Nasdaq-100 Shares may not always correspond to
market price. The net asset value of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size
aggregations and, proportionately, the net asset value per Nasdaq-100 Share
changes as fluctuations occur in the market value of the Securities. Investors
should also be aware that the aggregate public trading market price of 50,000
Nasdaq-100 Shares may be different from the net asset value of a Creation Unit
size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares (i.e., 50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares may trade
at a premium over or at a discount to the net asset value of a Creation Unit)
and similarly the public trading market price per Nasdaq-100 Share may be
different from the net asset value of a Creation Unit on a per Nasdaq-100 Share
basis. This price difference may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply
and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for Nasdaq-100 Shares
will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing
the prices of the Index component securities trading individually or in the
aggregate at any point in time. The expenses


                                       15
<PAGE>

of the Trust, which are accrued daily, are reflected in the net asset value of
Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations.

     Trading in Nasdaq-100 Shares on the Amex may be halted due to market
conditions or, in light of Amex rules and procedures for reasons that, in the
view of the Amex, make trading in Nasdaq-100 Shares inadvisable. In addition,
trading in Nasdaq-100 Shares on the Amex is subject to trading halts caused by
extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Amex "circuit breaker" rules that
require trading in securities on the Amex to be halted for a specified time
period based on a specified market decline. There can be no assurance that the
requirements of the Amex necessary to maintain the listing of Nasdaq-100 Shares
will continue to be met or will remain unchanged. The Trust will be terminated
in the event Nasdaq-100 Shares are delisted from the Amex and are not
subsequently relisted on a national securities exchange or a quotation medium
operated by a national securities association.

     Nasdaq-100 Shares are subject to the risk of an investment in a portfolio
of equity securities in economic sectors in which the Index may be highly
concentrated (e.g., technology) as well as to the risks specific to the
performance of a few individual component Securities which currently represent
a highly concentrated weighting in the Index. These include the risks that the
level of stock prices in these sectors or the stock prices of these specific
companies may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of Nasdaq-100
Shares. In addition, because it is the policy of the Trust to invest in the
securities that comprise the Index, if the Index is concentrated in an industry
or group of industries, the portfolio of Securities also will be concentrated
in that industry or group of industries. Furthermore, investors should be aware
that in the event that one or more stocks which currently have a highly
concentrated weighting in the Index were to leave The Nasdaq Stock Market, if a
company with a large market capitalization were to list its shares on The
Nasdaq Stock Market, or if there were a significant rebalancing of the Index,
then the composition and weighting of the Index, and hence the composition and
weighting of the Securities in the Trust, would change significantly and the
performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares would reflect the performance of the new Index
as reconfigured.

     Furthermore, due to the concentration of the Index in sectors
characterized by relatively higher volatility in price performance when
compared to other economic sectors, the performance of the Index may be more
volatile when compared to other broad-based stock indices. It is anticipated
that the price volatility of Nasdaq-100 Shares may be greater than the price
volatility of other market-traded securities which are issued by investment
companies based upon indices other than the Index.

     Nasdaq-100 Shares are also subject to risks other than those associated
with an investment in a broad market portfolio of equity securities in that


                                       16
<PAGE>

the selection of the securities included in the Trust's portfolio, the expenses
associated with the Trust, or other factors distinguishing an ownership interest
in a trust from the direct ownership of a portfolio of securities may affect
trading the Nasdaq-100 Shares as compared with trading in a broad market
portfolio of equity securities.

     The Trustee will ordinarily deliver a portfolio of Securities for each
Creation Unit size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares delivered for redemption,
substantially identical in composition to the Securities portion of a Portfolio
Deposit as in effect on the date a request for redemption is deemed received by
the Trustee. If a redemption is processed through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, to the extent that the Securities to be delivered on settlement date
are not delivered, they will be covered by NSCC's guarantee of the completion of
such delivery. Any Securities not received on settlement date will be marked to
the market on a daily basis until delivery is completed. The Trust, to the
extent it has not already done so, remains obligated to deliver such Securities
to NSCC, and the market risk of any increase in the value of such Securities
until delivery is made by the Trust to NSCC could adversely affect the net asset
value of the Trust. Investors should note that the Securities to be delivered to
a redeemer submitting a redemption request outside of the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process that are not delivered to such redeemer are not covered by NSCC's
guarantee of completion of such delivery.

     The Sponsor of the Trust has been granted a license to use the Nasdaq-100
Index as a basis for determining the composition of the Trust and to use
certain trade names and trademarks of Nasdaq. The Trust may be terminated if
the license agreement is terminated.

Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1
Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Sponsor, Trustee and the Unitholders of the Nasdaq-100 Trust,
Series 1:

     We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
the Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust"), including the schedule of
investments, as of September 30, 2003, and the related statements of operations
and changes in net assets for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2003, and the financial highlights for each of the periods from
March 5, 1999 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2003. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Trust's Sponsor, Nasdaq Financial Products Services, Inc. (the "Sponsor"). Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2003, by correspondence
with the Trust's custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements and the financial highlights
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 at September 30, 2003, the results
of its operations, the changes in its net assets, and the financial highlights
for each of the indicated periods, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

*     Not annualized

**    Annualized

(1)   Amounts have been adjusted for the effect of a 2-for-1 stock split which
      occurred on March 17, 2000.

(2)   For 2003, ordinary operating expenses incurred by the Trust did not exceed
      the 0.20% per annum level and, accordingly, no expenses of the Trust were
      assumed by the Sponsor. For 2002, amounts are shown prior to the refund of
      the Commission filing fees. With such refund, the expenses to average net
      assets and net investment loss ratios would have been 0.18% and (0.11%),
      respectively. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, amounts are shown net of expenses
      assumed by the Sponsor. If the Trust had borne all expenses, the expenses
      to average net assets and net investment loss ratios would have been 0.18%
      and (0.13%) for the year ended September 30, 2001, 0.19% and (0.16%) for
      the year ended September 30, 2000 and 0.50% and (0.44%) for the period

Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1
Notes to Financial Statements
September 30, 2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Organization

     Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust
created under the laws of the State of New York and registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with
the opportunity to purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust
representing proportionate undivided interests in the portfolio of securities
held by the Trust consisting of substantially all of the securities, in
substantially the same weighting, as the component securities of the Nasdaq-100
Index.

     The Trust commenced operations on March 5, 1999 upon the initial issuance
of 150,000 shares of the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock (equivalent to three
Creation Units) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect
the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of
significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

Security Valuation

     Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on The
Nasdaq Stock Market, which is deemed to be the principal market for the
securities. If no closing sale price is available, then the security is valued
at the closing bid price on The Nasdaq Stock Market. If there is no closing bid
price available, valuation will be determined by the Trustee in good faith
based on available information.

Investment Transactions


     Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on a specific
identification basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.



                                       23

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Distributions to Unitholders

     The Trust will declare and distribute dividends, if any, from net
investment income quarterly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital
gains, if any, at least annually. Distributions will only occur in the event
that dividends accumulated and other income received by the Trust exceed Trust
fees and expenses during such period.

Federal Income Tax

     The Trust has qualified and intends to continue to qualify for and elect
treatment as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By so qualifying, the Trust will not
be subject to federal income taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable
income, including any net realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In
addition, by distributing during each calendar year substantially all of its
net investment income and capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject
to federal excise tax. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. To the extent these
differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified within the capital
accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary differences do
not require such reclassification.

     At September 30, 2003, permanent differences primarily due to the tax
treatment of in-kind transactions and net operating losses resulted in a net
decrease in accumulated net investment loss of $5,488,396, a net increase in
accumulated net realized loss on investments of $850,621,587 and a
corresponding increase to paid in surplus of $845,133,191. This
reclassification had no effect on net assets of the Trust.

     At September 30, 2003, permanent differences primarily due to the tax
treatment of in-kind transactions and net operating losses resulted in a net
decrease in accumulated net investment loss, a net increase in accumulated net
realized loss on investments and a corresponding increase to paid in surplus.
This reclassification had no effect on net assets of the Trust.

     Capital losses incurred after October 31 ("post-October" losses) within
the taxable year are deemed to arise on the first business day of the Trust's
next taxable year. The Trust incurred and will elect to defer net capital
losses of $3,015,763,652 for the year ended September 30, 2003. These carryover
losses may be used to offset future gains. To the extent they are so used,
future gains will not be distributed to unitholders until they exceed available
loss carryovers.

3. Transactions with the Trustee and Sponsor


     The Trust pays the expenses of its operations, including the fees of its
Trustee and reimbursement to Nasdaq Financial Products Services, Inc. (formerly,
Nasdaq Investment Product Services, Inc.) (the "Sponsor") for expenses of the
Sponsor relating to the marketing of the Trust and for payments to The Nasdaq
Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") for a license to use the Nasdaq-100 Index as a
basis for determining the composition and weighting of securities held by the
Trust. The annual license fee to Nasdaq is 4/100 of one percent (0.04%) of the
average net assets of the Trust. Currently, the License Agreement is scheduled
to expire on March 10, 2004 in accordance with its terms and is subject to a
five-year renewal period following such date. In accordance with the terms of
the License Agreement, the Sponsor has notified Nasdaq of its intention to renew
the License Agreement for another five years or until March 10, 2009. Nasdaq
paid the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the organization of the
Trust and its initial registration as an investment company, and such expenses
were not borne by the Trust.


     In accordance with the Trust Agreement, The Bank of New York (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities, which must be
delivered in exchange for the issuance of Creation Units of the Trust, and for
adjusting the composition of the Trust's portfolio from time to time to conform
to changes in the composition and/or weighting structure of the Nasdaq-100
Index. For these services, the Trustee receives a fee at the following annual
rates:

               Net Asset Value                   Fee as a Percentage of Net
                 of the Trust                     Asset Value of the Trust
---------------------------------------------   ---------------------------
$0 - $499,999,999*                               10/100 of 1% per annum

$500,000,000 - $2,499,999,999*                   8/100 of 1% per annum

$2,500,000,000 - $24,999,999,999*                6/100 of 1% per annum

$25,000,000,000 - $49,999,999,999*               5/100 of 1% per annum

$50,000,000,000 and over*                        4/100 of 1% per annum

*     The fee indicated applies to that portion of the net asset value of the
      Trust which falls in the size category indicated.

3. Transactions with the Trustee and Sponsor (Continued)

     The minimum annual fee which shall be paid to the Trustee is $180,000. To
the extent that the amount of the Trustee's compensation is less than such
minimum annual fee, the Sponsor has agreed to pay the amount of any such
shortfall.

     Until the Sponsor otherwise determines, the ordinary operating expenses of
the Trust as calculated by the Trustee would not be permitted to exceed an
amount which is 20/100 of one percent (0.20%) per annum of the daily net asset
value of the Trust. Prior to October 1, 2001, the ordinary operating expenses
of the Trust as calculated by the Trustee were not permitted to exceed an
amount which is 18/100 of one percent (0.18%) per annum of the daily net asset
value of the Trust. To the extent during such periods that ordinary operating
expenses of the Trust exceeded such amounts, the Sponsor reimbursed the Trust
or assumed invoices on behalf of the Trust for such excess ordinary operating
expenses.

     The Sponsor retains the ability to be repaid by the Trust for expenses so
reimbursed or assumed to the extent that subsequently during the fiscal year
expenses fall below the applicable per annum level on any given day. For the
year ended September 30, 2003, ordinary operating expenses incurred by the
Trust did not exceed the 0.20% per annum level and, accordingly, no expenses of
the Trust were assumed by the Sponsor. During 2002, the Trust was refunded
previously paid 2001 Commission filing fees of $4,109,251, which permitted the
Sponsor to be reimbursed in 2002 for the previously assumed expenses in 2001.
The reimbursement resulted in a reduction of expenses assumed by the Sponsor of
$148,486 for the year ended September 30, 2002. During 2001, ordinary operating
expenses incurred by the Trust exceeded the 0.18% per annum level and,
accordingly, the Sponsor assumed expenses of $149,377 incurred by the Trust.

     In addition, $5,428,241 of expenses paid by the Sponsor on behalf of the
Trust for invoices received directly by the Sponsor during the year remain
payable to the Sponsor at September 30, 2003.

     ALPS Distributors, Inc. (the "Distributor") is the distributor for the
Trust. The Sponsor, not the Trust, pays the Distributor for its services a flat
annual fee.

</TABLE>

     Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking shares are issued and redeemed by the Trust only
in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000 Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking shares.
Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a separate cash
payment that is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income per
Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking share and a balancing cash component to equate the
transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the transaction
date. The transaction fee charged in connection with creation or redemption of
Creation Units through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is either $0, $500, or
$1,000 per participating party per day, depending on specific circumstances. The
total fee charged in connection with the creation or redemption of Creation
Units outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is $4,000 per participating party
per day.

     Transaction fees are received by the Trustee from the Participating Party,
as defined, and used to offset the expense of processing orders. For the years
ended September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Trustee earned $361,000, $377,000
and $762,000, respectively, in transaction fees. The Trustee, in its sole
discretion, may voluntarily reduce or waive its fee, or modify its transaction
fee schedule, subject to certain limitations. There were no such reductions or
waivers for the years ended September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

5. Investment Transactions

     For the year ended September 30, 2003, the Trust had purchases and sales
of investment securities of $2,480,583,099 and $2,484,441,812, respectively.
This includes securities received or delivered from processing creations or
redemptions of Trust shares. At September 30, 2003, the cost of investments for
federal income tax purposes was $33,798,148,200. Accordingly, gross unrealized
depreciation was $14,479,536,090 and gross unrealized appreciation was
$743,077,054, resulting in net unrealized depreciation of $13,736,459,036.

6. Reclassification

     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current
year classification. Accordingly, net realized loss on sale of investments and
net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments included in
the statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2002 were
decreased and increased by $529,718,413, respectively. The net realized loss on
investment transactions and net change in unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on investments included in the statement of changes in net
assets for the year ended September 30, 2002 were adjusted by the same amount.
This reclassification had no impact on net assets or the net increase
(decrease) in net assets resulting from operations.

                             SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Investors in the Trust should be aware that the Sponsor of the Trust is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Nasdaq. Nasdaq is the proprietor of the Index as
well as the operator of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the marketplace where the
Index Securities are listed. Nasdaq and the Amex, the exchange on which
Nasdaq-100 Shares are listed, operate as separate affiliates of the NASD.

     Under the terms of a license agreement with Nasdaq, the Sponsor has been
granted a license to use the Index as a basis for determining the composition
of the Trust and to use certain service marks and trademarks of Nasdaq in
connection with the Trust (see "License Agreement"). Under the terms of the
license agreement, the Sponsor pays to Nasdaq an annual licensing fee for use
of the Index. The Sponsor ordinarily will seek reimbursement from the Trust for
the amount of licensing fees (see "Expenses of the Trust").

     The Index is determined, composed, and calculated by Nasdaq without regard
to the Sponsor, the Trust, or the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares.
Nasdaq has complete control and sole discretion in determining, composing, or
calculating the Index or in modifying in any way its method for determining,
composing, or calculating the Index in the future.

                                    THE TRUST

     The Trust, an exchange traded fund or "ETF," is a registered investment
company which both (a) continuously issues and redeems "in-kind" its shares,
known as Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock or QQQ(SM), only in large lot sizes
called Creation Units at their once-daily NAV and (b) lists the shares
individually for trading on the Amex at prices established throughout the
trading day, like any other listed equity security trading in the secondary
market on the Exchange. The Securities held by the Trust consist of a portfolio
of equity securities or, in the case of securities not yet delivered in
connection with purchases made by the Trust or Portfolio Deposits,
confirmations of contracts to purchase such securities (collectively, the
"Portfolio").

Creation of Creation Units

     Portfolio Deposits may be deposited with the Trustee via instructions
submitted through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process of NSCC, following placement
with the Distributor of orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares by a person who has
executed a Participant Agreement with the Distributor and the Trustee. The
Distributor shall reject any order that is not submitted in proper form.
Investors may deposit Portfolio Deposits through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process or directly with the Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing


                                       32
<PAGE>

Process. The Transaction Fee will be charged at the time of creation of a
Creation Unit size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares. An additional amount not
to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for a Creation Unit
will be charged to a creator creating outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process
(i.e., depositing Portfolio Deposits directly with the Trustee through DTC), in
part due to the increased expense associated with settlement outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process.

     The Trustee and the Sponsor, from time to time and for such periods as
they may determine, together may increase(4) or reduce the amount and/or waive
the imposition altogether of the Transaction Fee (and/or the additional amounts
charged in connection with creations and/or redemptions outside the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process) for certain numbers of Creation Units of Nasdaq-100 Shares
created or redeemed, whether applied solely to creations and/or redemptions
made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, solely to creations and/or
redemptions made outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, or to both methods of
creation and/or redemption. The Sponsor also reserves the right, from time to
time, to vary the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares per Creation Unit (currently
50,000 shares) and such change may or may not be made in conjunction with a
change to the Transaction Fee. The occurrence of any increase, reduction, or
waiver of the Transaction Fee and the number of Creation Units created or
redeemed to which such increase, reduction, or waiver applies shall be
disclosed in the then current Nasdaq-100 Share Prospectus.

     The Sponsor makes available on each Business Day a list of the names and
the required number of shares for each of the securities in the current
Portfolio Deposit as well as the Income Net of Expense Amount effective through
and including the previous Business Day per outstanding Nasdaq-100 Share. The
Sponsor may choose within its discretion to make available, frequently
throughout each Business Day, a number representing, on a per Nasdaq-100 Share
basis, the sum of the Income Net of Expense Amount effective through and
including the previous Business Day plus the current value of the securities
portion of a Portfolio Deposit as in effect on such day (which value will
occasionally include a cash-in-lieu amount to compensate for the omission of a
particular Index Security from such Portfolio Deposit, see "The
Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit"). The Nasdaq Stock Market
calculates the Nasdaq-100 Index intra-day every 15 seconds on every

-----------------------
(4)   Such increase is subject to the 10 Basis Point Limit discussed above under
      "Highlights--Average Annual Total Returns." Redemption of Nasdaq-100
      Shares or of the additional amounts charged in connection with the
      creation or redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares outside the Nasdaq-100
      Clearing Process is beyond that which is discussed herein under the
      caption "Highlights--Average Annual Total Returns."


                                       33
<PAGE>

business day in which The Nasdaq Stock Market is open for trading. If the
Sponsor elects to make such information available, it would be calculated based
upon the best information available to the Sponsor and may be calculated by
other persons designated to do so by the Sponsor. If the Sponsor elects to make
such information available, the inability of the Sponsor or its designee to
provide such information for any period of time will not in itself result in a
halt in the trading of Nasdaq-100 Shares on the Amex. If such information is
made available, investors interested in creating Nasdaq-100 Shares or
purchasing Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market should not rely solely on
such information in making investment decisions but should also consider other
market information and relevant economic and other factors (including, without
limitation, information regarding the Index, the Index Securities, and
financial instruments based on the Index).

     Upon receipt of one or more Portfolio Deposits following placement with
the Distributor of an order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Trustee will
register the ownership of the Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size
aggregations in the name of the DTC or its nominee. In turn, the Nasdaq-100
Share position will be removed from the Trustee's account at the DTC and will
be allocated to the account of the DTC Participant acting on behalf of the
depositor creating Creation Unit(s). Each Nasdaq-100 Share represents a
fractional undivided interest in the Trust in an amount equal to one (1)
divided by the total number of Nasdaq-100 Shares outstanding. The Trustee may
reject a request to create Creation Units made by any depositor or group of
depositors if such depositor(s), upon the acceptance by the Trustee of such
request and the issuance to such depositor(s) of Nasdaq-100 Shares, would own
eighty percent (80%) or more of the outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Trustee
also may reject any Portfolio Deposit or any component thereof under certain
other circumstances. In the event there is a failure to deliver the Index
Securities which are the subject of such contracts to purchase or the Cash
Component includes cash in lieu of the delivery of one or more Index
Securities, the Trustee will be instructed pursuant to the Trust Agreement to
acquire such Index Securities in an expeditious manner. Hence, price
fluctuations during the period from the time the cash is received by the
Trustee to the time the requisite Index Securities are purchased and delivered
will affect the value of all Nasdaq-100 Shares.

Procedures for Creation of Creation Units

     All orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares must be placed in multiples of
50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares (Creation Unit size). All orders to create Nasdaq-100
Shares, whether through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process or outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, must be received by the Distributor by no later
than the closing time of the regular trading session on The Nasdaq Stock Market
("Closing Time") (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) in each case on


                                       34
<PAGE>

the date such order is placed in order for creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares to be
effected based on the net asset value of the Trust as determined on such date.
Orders must be transmitted by telephone or other transmission method acceptable
to the Distributor and Trustee, pursuant to procedures set forth in the
Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement, as described in this prospectus. Severe
economic or market changes or disruptions, or telephone or other communication
failure, may impede the ability to reach the Trustee, the Distributor, a
Participating Party, or a DTC Participant. Nasdaq-100 Shares may also be
created in advance of the receipt by the Trustee of all or a portion of the
securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit relating to such Nasdaq-100 Shares,
but only through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. In such cases, the
Participating Party intending to utilize this procedure will be required to
post collateral with the Trustee outside of NSCC consisting of cash at least
equal to 115% of the closing value, on the day the order is deemed received, of
the portion of the Portfolio Deposit not expected to be available in the
account of the Participating Party for delivery to the Trust on the third NSCC
Business Day following placement of such order, as such amount is marked-to-the-
market daily by the Trustee only for increases in such value. This cash
collateral will be required to be posted with the Trustee by 11:00 a.m. Eastern
time on the morning of the NSCC Business Day following the day such order is
deemed received by the Distributor, or else the order to create Nasdaq-100
Shares will be canceled. The Trustee will hold such collateral in an account
separate and apart from the Trust. Under NSCC rules, by midnight of the day
following the receipt by NSCC of such order, NSCC will normally guarantee to
the Trustee the delivery of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit on
the third NSCC Business Day following receipt of such order or on a later date.
Provided that the NSCC guarantee is established, the Trustee will issue the
Nasdaq-100 Shares (in Creation Unit size aggregations) so ordered on such third
NSCC Business Day, relying on the NSCC guarantee to make good on the delivery
of the Portfolio Deposit. In the event that the required securities are not
delivered on such third NSCC Business Day, the Trustee will take steps to
"buy-in" the missing portion of the Portfolio Deposit in accordance with NSCC
rules. The 115% cash collateral received from the creator will be returned net
of commissions and other buy-in expenses incurred by the Trustee, if any,
promptly upon settlement of delivery of all of the securities portion of the
Portfolio Deposit, or buy-in of all missing securities, or cancellation of the
order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares. Information concerning the procedures for
such cash collateralization is available from the Distributor.

     All questions as to the number of shares of each of the Index Securities,
the amount and identity of the payor of the Cash Component (i.e., the Trustee
on behalf of the Trust or the Nasdaq-100 Share creator), and the validity,
form, eligibility (including time of receipt), and acceptance for deposit of
any


                                       35
<PAGE>

Index Securities to be delivered shall be determined by the Trustee, whose
determination shall be final and binding. The Trustee reserves the absolute
right to reject a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor in
respect of any Portfolio Deposit or any component thereof if (a) the depositor
or group of depositors, upon obtaining the Nasdaq-100 Shares ordered, would own
80% or more of the current outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares; (b) the Portfolio
Deposit is not in proper form; (c) acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would
have certain adverse tax consequences (see "Tax Status of the Trust"); (d) the
acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be
unlawful; (e) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would otherwise, in the
discretion of the Trustee, have an adverse effect on the Trust or the rights of
Beneficial Owners; or (f) in the event that circumstances outside the control
of the Trustee make it for all practical purposes impossible to process
creations of Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Trustee and the Sponsor shall not incur any
liability in connection with any notification of defects or irregularities in
the delivery of Portfolio Deposits or any component thereof or in connection
with the rejection of a creation order.

Placement of Creation Orders Using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process

     Portfolio Deposits created through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process must be
delivered through a Participating Party that has executed a participant
agreement with the Distributor and with the Trustee (as the same may be from
time to time amended in accordance with its terms, the "Nasdaq-100 Participant
Agreement"). The Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement authorizes the Trustee to
transmit to NSCC on behalf of the Participating Party such trade instructions
as are necessary to effect the Participating Party's creation order. Pursuant
to such trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the Participating Party
agrees to transfer the requisite Index Securities (or contracts to purchase
such Index Securities that are expected to be delivered in a "regular way"
manner through NSCC by the third (3rd) NSCC Business Day) and the Cash
Component (if required) to the Trustee, together with such additional
information as may be required by the Trustee.

Placement of Creation Orders Outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process

     Portfolio Deposits created outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process must be
delivered through a DTC Participant that has executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant
Agreement with the Distributor and with the Trustee and has stated in its order
that it is not using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process and that creation will
instead be effected through a transfer of stocks and cash. The requisite number
of Index Securities must be delivered through DTC to the account of the Trustee
by no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern time of the next Business Day immediately
following the Transmittal Date. The Trustee, through the Federal Reserve Bank
wire system, must receive the Cash


                                       36
<PAGE>

Component no later than 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the next Business Day
immediately following the Transmittal Date. If the Trustee does not receive
both the requisite Index Securities and the Cash Component (if required) in a
timely fashion on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal
Date, such order will be canceled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such
canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Portfolio
Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the current net asset value of the
Trust. The delivery of Nasdaq-100 Shares so created will occur no later than
the third (3rd) Business Day following the day on which the creation order is
deemed received by the Distributor.

Securities Depository; Book-Entry-Only System

     The DTC acts as securities depository for Nasdaq-100 Shares. Cede & Co.,
as nominee for the DTC, is registered as the record owner of all Nasdaq-100
Shares on the books of the Trustee. Certificates will not be issued for
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     The DTC has advised the Sponsor and the Trustee as follows: the DTC is a
limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New
York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing corporation" within
the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a "clearing agency"
registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. The DTC was created to hold securities of its
participants (the "DTC Participants") and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions among the DTC Participants in such
securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the DTC
Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations, some
of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTCC, the parent company of the DTC
and NSCC. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as banks,
brokers, dealers, and trust companies that maintain a custodial relationship
with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (the "Indirect
Participants").

     Upon the settlement date of any creation, transfer, or redemption of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, the DTC will credit or debit, on its book-entry registration
and transfer system, the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares so created, transferred,
or redeemed to the accounts of the appropriate DTC Participants. The accounts
to be credited and charged shall be designated by the Trustee to NSCC, in the
case of a creation or redemption through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, or by
the Trustee and the DTC Participant, in the case of a creation or redemption
transacted outside of the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. Beneficial ownership of
Nasdaq-100 Shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants, and
persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants.


                                       37
<PAGE>

Ownership of beneficial interests in Nasdaq-100 Shares (owners of such
beneficial interests are referred to herein as "Beneficial Owners") will be
shown on, and the transfer of ownership will be effected only through, records
maintained by the DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of
DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners
that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners are expected to receive from
or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their
purchase of Nasdaq-100 Shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to
acquire beneficial interests in Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     So long as Cede & Co., as nominee of the DTC, is the registered owner of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, references herein to the registered or record owners of
Nasdaq-100 Shares shall mean Cede & Co. and shall not mean the Beneficial
Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares will not be
entitled to have Nasdaq-100 Shares registered in their names, will not receive
or be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificates in definitive form,
and will not be considered the record or registered holder thereof under the
Trust Agreement. Accordingly, each Beneficial Owner must rely on the procedures
of the DTC, the DTC Participant, and any Indirect Participant through which
such Beneficial Owner holds its interests, to exercise any rights of a holder
of Nasdaq-100 Shares under the Trust Agreement.

     The Trustee recognizes the DTC or its nominee as the owner of all
Nasdaq-100 Shares for all purposes except as expressly set forth in the Trust
Agreement. Pursuant to the agreement between the Trustee and DTC (the
"Depository Agreement"), the DTC is required to make available to the Trustee
upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the
Nasdaq-100 Share holdings of each DTC Participant. The Trustee shall inquire of
each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding
Nasdaq-100 Shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The
Trustee shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice,
statement, or other communication, in such form, number, and at such place as
such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice,
statement, or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trustee on
behalf of the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and
reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such
transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.

     Nasdaq-100 Share distributions shall be made to the DTC or its nominee,
Cede & Co. Upon receipt of any payment of distributions in respect of the
Nasdaq-100 Shares, the DTC or Cede & Co. is required immediately to credit DTC
Participants' accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their
respective beneficial interests in the Nasdaq-100 Shares, as shown on the


                                       38
<PAGE>

records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect
Participants and Beneficial Owners of the Nasdaq-100 Shares held through such
DTC Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary
practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
customers in bearer form or registered in a "street name," and will be the
responsibility of such DTC Participants. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor
has or will have any responsibility or liability for any aspects of the records
relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of
beneficial ownership interests in the Nasdaq-100 Shares, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership
interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between the DTC and the
DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the
Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC
Participants.

     The DTC may determine to discontinue providing its service with respect to
Nasdaq-100 Shares at any time by giving notice to the Trustee and the Sponsor
and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law.
Under such circumstances, the Trustee and the Sponsor shall take action either
to find a replacement for the DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost
or, if such a replacement is unavailable, to terminate the Trust (see
"Administration of the Trust--Termination").

                         REDEMPTION OF NASDAQ-100 SHARES

     The Nasdaq-100 Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units. Creation
Units are redeemable in kind only and are not redeemable for cash except as
described under "Summary--Highlights--Termination of the Nasdaq-100 Trust."

Procedure for Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares

     Requests for redemptions of Creation Units may be made on any Business Day
through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process to the Trustee at its trust office at
101 Barclay Street, New York, NY 10286, or at such other office as may be
designated by the Trustee. Requests for redemptions of Creation Units may also
be made directly to the Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process.
Requests for redemptions shall not be made to the Distributor. In the case of
redemptions made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, the Transaction Fee
will be deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer or added to the
amount owed by the redeemer to the Trustee, as applicable. In case of
redemptions tendered directly to the Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, a total fee will be charged equal to the Transaction Fee plus an
additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable
for a Creation Unit (due in part to the increased expense associated with
delivery outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing


                                       39
<PAGE>

Process), and such amount will be deducted from the amount delivered to the
redeemer or added to the amount owed by the redeemer to the Trustee on behalf
of the Trust, as applicable (see "Summary"). In all cases, the tender of
Nasdaq-100 Shares for redemption and distributions to the redeemer (or payments
to the Trustee, as applicable) in respect of Nasdaq-100 Shares redeemed will be
effected through DTC and the relevant DTC Participant(s) to the Beneficial
Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the relevant DTC
Participant, as the case may be (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").

     The Trustee will transfer to the redeeming Beneficial Owner via DTC and
the relevant DTC Participant(s) a portfolio of Securities for each Creation
Unit size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares delivered, generally identical in
composition and weighting to the securities portion of a Portfolio Deposit as
in effect (1) on the date a request for redemption is deemed received by the
Trustee as described below, in the case of redemptions made either through the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process or outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process or (2)
on the date that notice of the termination of the Trust is given. The Trustee
also transfers via the relevant DTC Participant(s) to the redeeming Beneficial
Owner a "Cash Redemption Payment," which on any given Business Day is an amount
identical to the amount of the Cash Component and is equal to a proportional
amount of the following: dividends on all the Securities for the period through
the date of redemption, net of accrued expenses and liabilities for such period
not previously deducted (including, without limitation, (x) taxes or other
governmental charges against the Trust not previously deducted, if any, and (y)
accrued fees of the Trustee and other expenses of the Trust (including legal
and auditing expenses) and other expenses not previously deducted (see
"Expenses of the Trust")), plus or minus the Balancing Amount. The redeeming
Beneficial Owner must deliver to the Trustee any amount by which the amount
payable to the Trust by such Beneficial Owner exceeds the amount of the Cash
Redemption Payment ("Excess Cash Amounts"). For redemptions outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust will transfer
the Cash Redemption Amount (if required) and the securities to the redeeming
Beneficial Owner by the third (3rd) Business Day following the date on which
the request for redemption is deemed received. In cases in which the Cash
Redemption Amount is payable by the redeemer to the Trustee, the redeeming
Beneficial Owner (via the DTC and the relevant DTC Participants(s)) is required
to make payment of such cash amount by the third (3rd) NSCC Business Day, for
redemptions made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, or the first (1st)
Business Day, for redemptions outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process,
following the date on which the request for redemption is deemed received. The
Trustee will cancel all Nasdaq-100 Shares delivered upon redemption.


                                       40
<PAGE>

     If the Trustee determines that an Index Security is likely to be
unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for delivery by the Trust upon
the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations, the
Trustee shall have the right in its discretion to include the cash equivalent
value of such Index Security or Index Securities, based on the market value of
such Index Security or Index Securities as of the Evaluation Time on the date
such redemption is deemed received by the Trustee, in the calculation of the
Cash Redemption Amount in lieu of delivering such Index Security or Index
Securities to the redeemer.

     In connection with the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares, if a redeeming
investor requests redemption in cash, rather than in kind, with respect to one
or more Securities, the Trustee shall have the right in its discretion to
include the cash equivalent value of such Index Security or Index Securities,
based on the market value of such Index Security or Index Securities as of the
Evaluation Time on the date such redemption order is deemed received by the
Trustee, in the calculation of the Cash Redemption Amount in lieu of delivering
such Index Security or Index Securities to the redeemer. In such case, such
investor will pay the Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, plus an additional
amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for a
Creation Unit (see "Summary").

     The Trustee, in its discretion, upon the request of a redeeming investor,
may redeem Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such redeemer with a
portfolio of Securities differing in exact composition from the Index
Securities but not differing in net asset value from the then-current Portfolio
Deposit. Such a redemption is likely to be made only if it were to be
determined that this composition would be appropriate in order to maintain the
Portfolio's correlation to the composition and weighting of the Index.

     The Trustee may sell Securities to obtain sufficient cash proceeds to
deliver to the redeeming Beneficial Owner. To the extent cash proceeds are
received by the Trustee in excess of the amount required to be provided to the
redeeming Beneficial Owner, such cash amounts shall be held by the Trustee and
shall be applied in accordance with the guidelines applicable to Misweightings
(as defined below).

     If the income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other
distributions on the Securities is insufficient to allow distribution of the
Cash Redemption Amount to a redeemer of Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Trustee may
advance out of its own funds any amounts necessary in respect of redemptions of
Nasdaq-100 Shares; otherwise, the Trustee may sell Securities in an amount
sufficient to effect such redemptions. The Trustee may reimburse itself in the
amount of such advance, plus any amounts required by the Federal Reserve Board
which are related to such advance, together with interest thereon at a
percentage rate equal to the then current overnight federal funds rate, by


                                       41
<PAGE>

deducting such amounts from (1) dividend payments or other income of the Trust
when such payments or other income is received, (2) the amounts earned or
benefits derived by the Trustee on cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of
the Trust, and (3) the sale of Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that any advance remains outstanding for more than forty-five (45)
Business Days, the Trustee shall ordinarily sell Securities to reimburse itself
for such advance and any accrued interest thereon. Such advances will be
secured by a lien upon and a security interest in the assets of the Trust in
favor of the Trustee.

     The Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when so directed by the
Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the date of payment of
the NAV for more than five (5) Business Days following the date on which the
request for redemption is deemed received by the Trustee (1) for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed; (2) for any period during
which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the
Securities is not reasonably practicable; or (3) for such other period as the
Commission may by order permit for the protection of Beneficial Owners. Neither
the Sponsor nor the Trustee is liable to any person or in any way for any loss
or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.

     To be eligible to place orders with the Trustee to redeem Nasdaq-100
Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations, an entity or person must be (1) a
Participating Party, with respect to redemptions through the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process, or (2) a DTC Participant, with respect to redemptions outside
the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, and in either case must have executed a
Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement with the Distributor and the Trustee.

     All orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares must be placed in multiples of
50,000 shares (Creation Unit size). Orders must be transmitted to the Trustee
by telephone or other transmission method acceptable to the Trustee so as to be
received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on the Transmittal
Date, pursuant to procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement.
Severe economic or market changes or disruptions, or telephone or other
communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Trustee, a
Participating Party, or a DTC Participant.

     Orders to redeem Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares
shall be placed with a Participating Party or DTC Participant, as applicable,
in the form required by such Participating Party or DTC Participant. Investors
should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement, and that, therefore, orders to redeem Creation Unit size
aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares may have to be placed by the investor's
broker through a Participating Party or a DTC Participant who has executed a
Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement. At any given time there may be only a limited
number of broker-dealers that have executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant


                                       42
<PAGE>

Agreement. Those placing orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares should afford
sufficient time to permit (1) proper submission of the order by a Participating
Party or DTC Participant to the Trustee and (2) the receipt of the Nasdaq-100
Shares to be redeemed and the Cash Redemption Amount, if any, by the Trustee in
a timely manner, as described below. Orders for redemption that are effected
outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process are likely to require transmittal by
the DTC Participant earlier on the Transmittal Date than orders effected using
the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. Those persons placing orders outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process should ascertain the deadlines applicable to DTC
and the Federal Reserve Bank wire system by contacting the operations
department of the broker or depository institution effectuating such transfer
of Nasdaq-100 Shares and Cash Redemption Amount. These deadlines will vary by
institution. The Participant notified of an order to redeem outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process will be required to transfer Nasdaq-100 Shares
through DTC and the Cash Redemption Amount, if any, through the Federal Reserve
Bank wire system in a timely manner (see "Placement of Redemption Orders
Outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process"). Information regarding the Cash
Redemption Amount, number of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares, and Transaction
Fees may be obtained from the Trustee at the toll-free number: (888) 627-3837.


Placement of Redemption Orders Using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process

     A redemption order using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is deemed
received by the Trustee on the Transmittal Date if (i) such order is received
by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on such Transmittal Date and
(ii) all other procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement are
properly followed. A redemption order using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process
made in proper form but received by the Trustee after the Closing Time will be
deemed received on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal
Date. The Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement authorizes the Trustee to transmit
to NSCC on behalf of the Participating Party such trade instructions as are
necessary to effect the Participating Party's redemption order. Pursuant to
such trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the Trustee will transfer the
requisite Securities (or contracts to purchase such Securities which are
expected to be delivered in a "regular way" manner through NSCC) by the third
(3rd) NSCC Business Day following the date on which such request for redemption
is deemed received, and the Cash Redemption Amount, if any. If the Cash
Redemption Amount is owed by the Beneficial Owner to the Trustee, such amount
must be delivered by the third (3rd) NSCC Business Day following the date on
which the redemption request is deemed received.

Placement of Redemption Orders Outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process

     A DTC Participant who wishes to place an order for redemption of
Nasdaq-100 Shares to be effected outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process need
not be a Participating Party, but such orders must state that the DTC
Participant is not using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process and that redemption of
Nasdaq-100 Shares will instead be effected through transfer of Nasdaq-100
Shares directly through DTC. An order to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is deemed received by the Trustee on the
Transmittal Date if (i) such order is received by the Trustee not later than
the Closing Time on such Transmittal Date, (ii) such order is preceded or
accompanied by the requisite number of Nasdaq-100 Shares specified in such
order, which delivery must be made through DTC to the Trustee no later than the
Closing Time of the regular trading session on The Nasdaq Stock Market on such
Transmittal Date and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement are properly followed. The Cash Redemption Amount owed by
the Beneficial Owner, if any, must be delivered no later than 1:00 p.m. Eastern
time on the Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date.

     The Trustee will initiate procedures to transfer the requisite Securities
and the Cash Redemption Amount to the redeeming Beneficial Owner (where such
amount is payable from the Trustee to the Beneficial Owner) by the third (3rd)
Business Day following the Transmittal Date on which such redemption order is
deemed received by the Trustee.


                                 THE PORTFOLIO


     Because the objective of the Trust is to provide investment results that
generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Index, the
Portfolio will, under most circumstances, consist of all of the Index
Securities. It is anticipated that cash or cash items normally would not be a
substantial part of the Trust's net assets. Although the Trust may at any time
fail to own certain of the Index Securities, the Trust will be substantially
invested in Index Securities and the Sponsor believes that such investment
should result in a close correspondence between the investment performance of
the Index and that derived from ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares.



Adjustments to the Portfolio

     The Index is a modified capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the
largest non-financial securities listed on the Nasdaq National Market tier of
The Nasdaq Stock Market (see "The Index"). At any moment in time, the value of
the Index equals the aggregate value of the then-current Index share


                                       44
<PAGE>

weights of each of the component Index Securities multiplied by each such
security's respective last sale price on The Nasdaq Stock Market, divided by
Adjusted Base Period Market Value ("ABPMV"), and multiplied by the base value,
which results in the reported Index value. ABPMV serves the purpose of scaling
such aggregate value (otherwise in the trillions) to a lower order of magnitude
which is more desirable for Index reporting purposes.(5)


     Periodically (typically, several times per quarter), Nasdaq may determine
that total shares outstanding have changed in one or more Index Securities due
to secondary offerings, repurchases, conversions, or other corporate actions.
Under such circumstances, in accordance with Nasdaq policies and procedures for
making adjustments to the Index, the Index share weights would be adjusted by
the same percentage amounts by which the total shares outstanding have changed
in such Index Securities. Additionally, Nasdaq may replace one or more
component securities in the Index due to mergers and acquisitions,
bankruptcies, or other market conditions, or due to removal if an issuer fails
to meet the criteria for continued inclusion in the Index or it chooses to list
its securities on another marketplace. For example, for the 1998, 1999, 2000,
2001, 2002 and 2003 calendar years, there were 6, 15, 5, 6, 6 and 1 company
changes, respectively, made during those years due to corporate actions (e.g.,
mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies) and 9, 15, 12, 13, 15 and 8 other
company changes, respectively, made at year-end in connection with Nasdaq's
annual evaluation process for determining the securities comprising the Index
for the upcoming year (see "The Index--
Initial Eligibility Criteria" and "- Continued Eligibility Criteria"). The
ratio of the market capitalization of the securities replaced in the Index in
1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 to the total market capitalization of the
securities comprising the Index at year-end was 3.1%, 7.2%, 5.1%, 5.1%, 6.2%
and 2.20%, respectively.


     The Index share weights, which are based upon the total shares outstanding
in each of the Index Securities, are additionally subject, in certain cases, to
a rebalancing (see "The Index--Rebalancing of the Index"). Ordinarily, whenever
there is a change in Index share weights or a change in

-----------------------

(5)  For example, on December 31, 2003 the aggregate value of the then-current
    Index share weights of each of the Index Securities multiplied by their
    respective last sale price on The Nasdaq Stock Market was $2,219,644,052,
    ABPMV was 189,013,217 on December 31, 2003, the base value was 125, as
    adjusted, at the start of the Index, and the reported Index value was
    1467.92 on December 31, 2003. Please note that the market value and ABPMV
    are in thousands.



                                       45
<PAGE>

a component security included in the Index, Nasdaq adjusts ABPMV to assure that
there is no discontinuity in the value of the Index which might otherwise be
caused by any such change.

     Because the investment objective of the Trust is to provide investment
results that generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the
Index, composition and weighting changes, and associated ABPMV changes to the
Index, create the need for the Trustee to make corresponding adjustments to the
Securities held in the Trust as described below.

     The Trust is not managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of
an issuer does not require the sale of stocks from the Portfolio. The Trustee
on a nondiscretionary basis adjusts the composition of the Portfolio from time
to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or weighting of the Index
Securities. The Trustee aggregates certain of these adjustments and makes
conforming changes to the Trust's Portfolio at least monthly; however,
adjustments are made more frequently in the case of changes to the Index that
are significant. Specifically, the Trustee is required to adjust the
composition of the Portfolio at any time that there is a change in the identity
of any Index Security (i.e., a substitution of one security in replacement of
another), which adjustment is to be made within three (3) Business Days before
or after the day on which the change in the identity of such Index Security is
scheduled to take effect at the close of the market. Although the investment
objective of the Trust is to provide investment results which resemble the
performance of the Index, it is not always efficient to replicate identically
the share composition of the Index if the transaction costs incurred by the
Trust in so adjusting the Portfolio would exceed the expected misweighting that
would ensue by failing to replicate identically minor and insignificant share
changes to the Index. Accordingly, to further the investment objective of the
Trust, minor misweightings are generally permitted within the guidelines set
forth below. The Trustee is required to adjust the composition of the Portfolio
at any time that the weighting of any Security varies in excess of one hundred
fifty percent (150%) of a specified percentage (a "Misweighting Amount"), from
the weighting of such Security in the Index (a "Misweighting"). The
Misweighting Amounts vary depending on the net asset value of the Trust and are
set forth in the table below:

                                                Misweighting
Net Asset Value of the Trust                       Amount
--------------------------------------------   -------------
Less than $25,000,000 ......................       0.25%
$25,000,000 -- $99,999,999 .................       0.20%
$100,000,000 -- $499,999,999 ...............       0.10%
$500,000,000 -- $999,999,999 ...............       0.05%
$1,000,000,000 and over ....................       0.02%


                                      46
<PAGE>

     The Trustee examines each Security in the Portfolio on each Business Day,
comparing the weighting of each such Security in the Portfolio to the weighting
of the corresponding Index Security in the Index, based on prices at the close
of the market on the preceding Business Day (a "Weighting Analysis"). In the
event that there is a Misweighting in any Security in excess of one hundred
fifty percent (150%) of the applicable Misweighting Amount, the Trustee shall
calculate an adjustment to the Portfolio in order to bring the Misweighting of
such Security within the Misweighting Amount, based on prices at the close of
the market on the day on which such Misweighting occurs. Also, on a monthly
basis, the Trustee shall perform a Weighting Analysis for each Security in the
Portfolio, and in any case in which there exists a Misweighting exceeding one
hundred percent (100%) of the applicable Misweighting Amount, the Trustee shall
calculate an adjustment to the Portfolio in order to bring the Misweighting of
such Security within the applicable Misweighting Amount, based on prices at the
close of the market on the day on which such Misweighting occurs. In the case
of any adjustment to the Portfolio due to a Misweighting as described herein,
the purchase or sale of securities necessitated by such adjustment shall be
made within three (3) Business Days of the day on which such Misweighting is
determined. In addition to the foregoing adjustments, the Trustee reserves the
right to make additional adjustments periodically to Securities that may be
misweighted by an amount within the applicable Misweighting Amount in order to
reduce the overall Misweighting of the Portfolio.

     The foregoing guidelines with respect to Misweightings shall also apply to
any Index Security that (1) is likely to be unavailable for delivery or
available in insufficient quantity for delivery or (2) cannot be delivered to
the Trustee due to restrictions prohibiting a creator from engaging in a
transaction involving such Index Security. Upon receipt of an order for a
Creation Unit that will involve such an Index Security, the Trustee shall
determine whether the substitution of cash for such Index Security will cause a
Misweighting in the Trust's Portfolio with respect to such Index Security. If a
Misweighting results, the Trustee shall purchase the required number of shares
of such Index Security on the opening of the market on the following Business
Day. If a Misweighting does not result and the Trustee would not hold cash in
excess of the permitted amounts described below, the Trustee may hold such cash
or, if such an excess would result, make the required adjustments to the
Portfolio in accordance with the procedures described herein.

     Pursuant to these guidelines, the Trustee shall calculate the required
adjustments and shall purchase and sell the appropriate securities. As a result
of the purchase and sale of securities in accordance with these requirements,
or the creation of Creation Units, the Trust may hold some amount of residual
cash (other than cash held temporarily due to timing differences between the
sale and purchase of securities or cash delivered in lieu of Index Securities


                                       47
<PAGE>

or undistributed income or undistributed capital gains) as a result of such
transactions, which amount shall not exceed for more than five (5) consecutive
Business Days 5/10th of 1 percent (0.5%) of the aggregate value of the
Securities. In the event that the Trustee has made all required adjustments and
is left with cash in excess of 5/10th of 1 percent (0.5%) of the aggregate
value of the Securities, the Trustee shall use such cash to purchase additional
Index Securities that are under-weighted in the Portfolio as compared to their
relative weighting in the Index, although the Misweighting of such Index
Securities may not be in excess of the applicable Misweighting Amount.

     In addition to adjustments to the Portfolio from time to time to conform
to changes in the composition or weighting of the Index Securities, the Trustee
is also ordinarily required to sell Securities to obtain sufficient cash
proceeds for the payment of Trust fees and expenses at any time that projected
annualized fees and expenses accrued on a daily basis exceed projected
annualized dividends and other Trust income accrued on a daily basis by more
than 1/100 of one percent (0.01%) of the net asset value of the Trust. Whenever
the 0.01% threshold is exceeded, the Trustee will sell sufficient Securities to
cover such excess no later than the next occasion it is required to make
adjustments to the Portfolio due to a Misweighting, unless the Trustee
determines, in its discretion, that such a sale is unnecessary because the cash
to be generated is not needed by the Trust at that time for the payment of
expenses then due or because the Trustee otherwise determines that such a sale
is not warranted or advisable. At the time of the sale, the Trustee shall first
sell Securities that are over-weighted in the Portfolio as compared to their
relative weighting in the Index.

     All Portfolio adjustments shall be made by the Trustee pursuant to the
foregoing specifications and as set forth in the Trust Agreement and shall be
nondiscretionary. All portfolio adjustments will be made as described herein
unless such adjustments would cause the Trust to lose its status as a
"regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Code. Additionally,
the Trustee is required to adjust the composition of the Portfolio at any time
if it is necessary to ensure the continued qualification of the Trust as a
regulated investment company. The adjustments provided herein are intended to
conform the composition and weighting of the Portfolio, to the extent
practicable, to the composition and weighting of the Index Securities. Such
adjustments are based upon the Index as it is currently determined by Nasdaq.
To the extent that the method of determining the Index is changed by Nasdaq in
a manner that would affect the adjustments provided for herein, the Trustee and
the Sponsor shall have the right to amend the Trust Agreement, without the
consent of the DTC or Beneficial Owners, to conform the adjustments provided
herein and in the Trust Agreement to such changes so that the objective of
tracking the Index is maintained.


                                       48
<PAGE>

     The Trustee relies on information made publicly available by Nasdaq as to
the composition and weighting of the Index Securities. If the Trustee becomes
incapable of obtaining or processing such information or NSCC is unable to
receive such information from the Trustee on any Business Day, then the Trustee
shall use the composition and weighting of the Index Securities for the most
recently effective Portfolio Deposit for the purposes of all adjustments and
determinations described herein (including, without limitation, determination
of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit) until the earlier of (a)
such time as current information with respect to the Index Securities is
available or (b) three (3) consecutive Business Days have elapsed. If such
current information is not available and three (3) consecutive Business Days
have elapsed, the composition and weighting of the Securities (as opposed to
the Index Securities) shall be used for the purposes of all adjustments and
determinations herein (including, without limitation, determination of the
securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit) until current information with
respect to the Index Securities is available.

     If the Trust is terminated, the Trustee shall use the composition and
weighting of the Securities held in the Trust as of the date of notice of the
Trust termination for the purpose and determination of all redemptions or other
required uses of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit.

     From time to time Nasdaq may make adjustments to the composition of the
Index as a result of a merger or acquisition involving one or more of the Index
Securities. In such cases, the Trust, as shareholder of securities of an issuer
that is the object of such merger or acquisition activity, may receive various
offers from would-be acquirers of the issuer. The Trustee is not permitted to
accept any such offers until such time as it has been determined that the
securities of the issuer will be removed from the Index. In selling the
securities of such issuer after it has been determined that the security will
be removed from the Index, the Trust may receive, to the extent that market
prices do not provide a more attractive alternative, whatever consideration is
being offered to the shareholders of such issuer that have not tendered their
shares prior to such time. Any cash received in such transactions will be
reinvested in Index Securities in accordance with the criteria set forth above.
Any securities received as a part of the consideration that are not Index
Securities will be sold as soon as practicable and the cash proceeds of such
sale will be reinvested in accordance with the criteria set forth above.

     Purchases and sales of Securities resulting from the adjustments described
above will be made in the share amounts dictated by the foregoing
specifications, whether round lot or odd lot. Certain Index Securities,
however, may at times not be available in the quantities that the foregoing
calculations require. For this and other reasons, precise duplication of the
proportionate relationship between the Portfolio and the Index Securities may
not ever be


                                       49
<PAGE>

attained but nevertheless will continue to be the objective of the Trust in
connection with all acquisitions and dispositions of Securities.


     The Trust is a unit investment trust registered under the 1940 Act and is
not a managed fund. Traditional methods of investment management for a managed
fund typically involve frequent changes to a portfolio of securities on the
basis of economic, financial, and market analyses. The Portfolio held by the
Trust, however, is not managed. Instead, the only purchases and sales that are
made with respect to the Portfolio will be those necessary to create a
portfolio that is designed to replicate the Index to the extent practicable,
taking into consideration the adjustments referred to above. Since no attempt
is made to manage the Trust in the traditional sense, the adverse financial
condition of an issuer will not be the basis for the sale of its securities
from the Portfolio unless the issuer is removed from the Index.


     The Trust will be liquidated on the fixed Mandatory Termination Date
unless terminated earlier under certain circumstances. In addition, Beneficial
Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations have the right
to redeem in kind.

Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit

     On each Business Day (each such day, an "Adjustment Day"), the number of
shares and/or identity of each of the Index Securities in a Portfolio Deposit
is adjusted in accordance with the following procedure. Generally, as of the
4:00 p.m. Eastern time market close on each Adjustment Day, the Trustee
calculates the net asset value of the Trust (see "Valuation"). The net asset
value is divided by the number of all outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares multiplied
by 50,000 shares in one Creation Unit aggregation resulting in an NAV. The
Trustee then calculates the number of shares (without rounding) of each of the
component securities of the Index in a Portfolio Deposit for the following
Business Day ("Request Day"), such that (1) the market value at the close of
the market on Adjustment Day of the securities to be included in the Portfolio
Deposit on Request Day, together with the Income Net of Expense Amount
effective for requests to create or redeem on Adjustment Day, equals the NAV
and (2) the identity and weighting of each of the securities in a Portfolio
Deposit mirror proportionately the identity and weighting of the securities in
the Index, each as in effect on Request Day. For each security, the number
resulting from such calculation is rounded to the nearest whole share, with a
fraction of 0.50 being rounded up. The identities and number of shares of the
securities so calculated constitute the securities portion of the Portfolio
Deposit effective on Request Day and thereafter until the next subsequent
Adjustment Day, as well as the Securities ordinarily to be delivered by the
Trustee in the event of a request for redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
Creation Unit size aggregations on Request Day and thereafter until


                                       50
<PAGE>

the following Adjustment Day (see "Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares"). In
addition to the foregoing adjustments, in the event that there shall occur a
stock split, stock dividend, or reverse split with respect to any Index
Security, the Portfolio Deposit shall be adjusted to take account of such stock
split, stock dividend, or reverse split by applying the stock split, stock
dividend, or reverse stock split multiple (e.g., in the event of a two-for-one
stock split of an Index Security, by doubling the number of shares of such
Index Security in the prescribed Portfolio Deposit), in each case rounded to
the nearest whole share, with a fraction of 0.50 being rounded up.

     On the Request Day and on each day that a request for the creation or
redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares is deemed received, the Trustee calculates the
market value of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit as in effect on
Request Day as of the close of the market and adds to that amount the Income
Net of Expense Amount effective for requests to create or redeem on Request Day
(such market value and Income Net of Expense Amount are collectively referred
to herein as the "Portfolio Deposit Amount"). The Trustee then calculates the
NAV, based on the close of the market on Request Day. The difference between
the NAV so calculated and the Portfolio Deposit Amount is the "Balancing
Amount." The Balancing Amount serves the function of compensating for any
differences between the value of the Portfolio Deposit Amount and the NAV at
the close of trading on Request Day due to, for example, (1) differences in the
market value of the securities in the Portfolio Deposit and the market value of
the Securities on Request Day and (2) any variances from the proper composition
of the Portfolio Deposit.

     On any Adjustment Day on which (a) no change in the identity and/or share
weighting of any Index Security is scheduled to take effect that would cause
ABPMV to be adjusted after the close of the market on such Business Day,(6) and
(b) no stock split, stock dividend, or reverse stock split with respect to any
Index Security has been declared to take effect on the corresponding Request
Day, the Trustee may forego making any adjustment to the securities portion of
the Portfolio Deposit and use the composition and weighting of the Index
Securities for the most recently effective Portfolio Deposit for the Request
Day following such Adjustment Day. In addition, the Trustee may calculate the
adjustment to the number of shares and/or identity of the Index Securities in a
Portfolio Deposit as described above except that such calculation would be
employed two (2) Business Days rather than one (1) Business Day prior to
Request Day.

-----------------------
(6)   Nasdaq normally publicly announces changes in the identity and/or
      weighting of the Index Securities in advance of the actual changes.


                                       51
<PAGE>

     The Income Net of Expense Amount and the Balancing Amount in effect at the
close of business on Request Day are collectively referred to as the Cash
Component (with respect to creations of Nasdaq-100 Shares) or the Cash
Redemption Amount (with respect to redemptions of Nasdaq-100 Shares). If the
resulting Cash Component has a positive value, then the creator of Nasdaq-100
Shares will be obligated to pay such cash to the Trustee in connection with
orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares; if the resulting Cash Component has a
negative value, then such cash shall be paid by the Trustee on behalf of the
Trust to the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Similarly, if the resulting Cash
Redemption Amount has a positive value, then such cash shall be transferred to
a redeemer by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust in connection with orders to
redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares; if the resulting Cash Redemption Amount has a
negative value, then such cash shall be paid by the redeemer of Nasdaq-100
Shares to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust.

     In the event that the Trustee has included the cash equivalent value of
one or more Index Securities in the Portfolio Deposit because the Trustee has
determined that such Index Securities are likely to be unavailable or available
in insufficient quantity for delivery, the Portfolio Deposit so constituted
shall dictate the Index Securities to be delivered in connection with the
creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations and upon the
redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations for all
purposes hereunder until such time as the securities portion of the Portfolio
Deposit is subsequently adjusted. Brokerage commissions incurred by the Trustee
in connection with the acquisition of any such Index Securities will be at the
expense of the Trust and will affect the value of all Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     In connection with the creation or redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares, if an
investor is restricted by regulation or otherwise from investing or engaging in
a transaction in one or more Index Securities, the Trustee, in its discretion,
shall have the right to include the cash equivalent value of such Index
Securities in the Portfolio Deposit in the calculation of the Cash Component
(or the Cash Redemption Amount, as the case may be) in lieu of the inclusion of
such Index Securities in the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit for
the particular affected investor. The amount of such cash equivalent payment
shall be used by the Trustee in accordance with the guidelines regarding
allowable Misweightings and permitted amounts of cash which may require the
Trustee to purchase the appropriate number of shares of the Index Security that
such investor was unable to purchase. In any such case, such investor shall pay
the Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, plus an additional amount not to
exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for a Creation Unit.

     The Trustee, in its discretion, upon the request of the redeeming
investor, may redeem Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such
redeemer with a portfolio of Securities differing in exact composition from the
Index


                                       52

Securities but not differing in net asset value from the then-current Portfolio
Deposit. Such a redemption is likely to be made only if it were to be
determined that this composition would be appropriate in order to maintain the
Portfolio of the Trust in correlation to the modified capitalization-weighted
composition of the Index, for instance, in connection with a replacement of one
of the Index Securities (e.g., due to a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy).

                                    THE INDEX

     The Sponsor selected the Nasdaq-100 Index as the basis for the selection
of the Securities to be held by the Trust because, in the opinion of the
Sponsor, the Index constitutes a broadly diversified segment of the largest
securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Additionally, the Index has
achieved wide acceptance by both investors and market professionals.
Specifically, the Index is composed of 100 of the largest non-financial
securities listed on the Nasdaq National Market tier of The Nasdaq Stock
Market.

     The Sponsor, which is wholly owned by Nasdaq, has been granted a license
to use the Index as a basis for determining the composition of the Trust and to
use certain service marks and trademarks of Nasdaq in connection with the Trust
(see "License Agreement"). Nasdaq is not responsible for and shall not
participate in the creation or sale of Nasdaq-100 Shares or in the
determination of the timing of, prices at, or quantities and proportions in
which purchases or sales of Index Securities or Securities shall be made. In
addition, Nasdaq determines, comprises and calculates the Index without regard
to the Trust.

     The Index was first published in January 1985, and includes companies
across a variety of major industry groups. The Index does not contain financial
companies, including registered investment companies. As of December 31, 2003,
the major industry groups covered in the Index (listed according to their
respective capitalization in the Index) were as follows: computer and office
equipment (31.93%), computer software/services (26.33%), telecommunications
(12.63%), retail/wholesale trade (9.79%), biotechnology (9.33%), health care
(3.66%), services (3.06%), manufacturing (2.41%) and transportation (0.86%).
The identity and capitalization weightings of the five largest companies
represented in the Index as of December 31, 2003 were as follows: Microsoft
Corporation (8.67%), Intel Corporation (6.23%), Cisco Systems, Inc. (5.07%),
QUALCOMM Inc. (4.40%), and Nextel Communications, Inc. (3.25%). Current
information regarding the market value of the Index is available from Nasdaq as
well as numerous market information services.

Initial Eligibility Criteria


     To be eligible for inclusion in the Index, a security must be listed on
the Nasdaq Stock Market and meet the following criteria:


      o     the security's U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq
            National Market (unless the security was dually listed on another
            U.S. market prior to January 1, 2004 and has continuously maintained
            such listing);


                                       54
<PAGE>

      o     the security must be of a non-financial company;

      o     the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy
            proceedings;

      o     the security must have average daily trading volume on Nasdaq of at
            least 200,000 shares;

      o     if the security is of a foreign issuer (based on its country of
            incorporation), it must have listed options or be eligible for
            listed-options trading;

      o     only one class of security per issuer is allowed;

      o     the issuer of the security may not have entered into a definitive
            agreement or other arrangement which would result in the security no
            longer being Index eligible within the next six months;

      o     the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements
            with an audit opinion which the auditor or the company has indicated
            cannot be currently relied upon;

      o     the security must have "seasoned" on Nasdaq or another recognized
            market (generally, a company is considered to be seasoned if it has
            been listed on a market for at least two years; in the case of
            spin-offs, the operating history of the spin-off will be
            considered); and

      o     if the security would otherwise qualify to be in the top 25% of the
            securities included in the Index by market capitalization for the
            six prior consecutive month-ends, then a one-year "seasoning"
            criterion would apply.


Continued Eligibility Criteria

     In addition, to be eligible for continued inclusion in the Index the
following criteria apply:

      o     the security's U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq
            National Market (unless the security was dually listed on another
            U.S. market prior to January 1, 2004 and has continuously maintained
            such listing);

      o     the security must be of a non-financial company;

      o     the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy
            proceedings;

      o     the security must have average daily trading volume of at least
            200,000 shares (measured annually during the ranking review
            process);

      o     if the security is of a foreign issuer (based on its country of
            incorporation), it must have listed options or be eligible for
            listed-options trading (measured annually during the ranking review
            process);

                                       55
<PAGE>


      o     the security must have an adjusted market capitalization equal to or
            exceeding 0.10% of the aggregate adjusted market capitalization of
            the Index at each month-end. In the event a company does not meet
            this criterion for two consecutive month-ends, it will be removed
            from the Index effective after the close of trading on the third
            Friday of the following month; and

      o     the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements
            with an audit opinion which the auditor or the company has indicated
            cannot be currently relied upon.

     These Index eligibility criteria may be revised from time to time by
Nasdaq without regard to the Trust.


     Except under extraordinary circumstances that may result in an interim
evaluation, the Index Securities are evaluated on an annual basis, as follows
(such evaluation is referred to herein as the "Ranking Review"). Securities
listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market which meet the above eligibility criteria are
ranked by market value. Index-eligible securities which are already in the
Index and which are ranked in the top 100 eligible securities (based on market
value) are retained in the Index. Those securities that are ranked 101 to 150
are also retained provided that such security was ranked in the top 100
eligible securities as of the previous Ranking Review. Securities not meeting
such criteria are replaced. The replacement securities chosen are those
Index-eligible securities not currently in the Index which have the largest
market capitalization. Generally, the list of annual additions and deletions is
publicly announced via a press release in the early part of December.
Replacements are made effective after the close of trading on the third Friday
in December. Moreover, if at any time during the year an Index Security is no
longer traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market, or is otherwise determined by Nasdaq
to become ineligible for continued inclusion in the Index, the security will be
replaced with the largest market capitalization security not currently in the
Index and meeting the Index eligibility criteria listed above.

     In addition to the Ranking Review, the securities in the Index are
monitored every day by Nasdaq with respect to changes in total shares
outstanding arising from secondary offerings, stock repurchases, conversions, or
other corporate actions. Nasdaq has adopted the following weight adjustment
procedures with respect to such changes. If the change in total shares
outstanding arising from stock splits or stock dividends is greater than or
equal to 5.0%, such change is generally made to the Index on the evening prior
to the effective date of such corporate action. If the change in total shares
outstanding arising from other corporate actions is greater than or equal to
5.0%, the change will be made as soon as practicable, normally within ten (10)
days of such action.



                                       56
<PAGE>

Otherwise, if the change in total shares outstanding is less than 5%, then all
such changes are accumulated and made effective at one time on a quarterly
basis after the close of trading on the third Friday in each of March, June,
September, and December. In either case, the Index share weights for such Index
Securities are adjusted by the same percentage amount by which the total shares
outstanding have changed in such Index Securities.


Calculation of the Index

     The Index is a modified capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the
largest non-financial securities listed on the Nasdaq National Market tier of
The Nasdaq Stock Market. The value of the Index equals the aggregate value of
the Index share weights of each of the component Index Securities multiplied by
each such security's respective last sale price on The Nasdaq Stock Market,
divided by ABPMV, and multiplied by the base value. ABPMV serves the purpose of
scaling such aggregate value (otherwise in the trillions) to a lower order of
magnitude which is more desirable for Index reporting purposes.(7) Ordinarily,
whenever there is a change in Index share weights or a change in a component
security included in the Index, Nasdaq adjusts ABPMV to assure that there is no
discontinuity in the value of the Index which might otherwise be caused by any
such change. Accordingly, each Index Security's influence on the value of the
Index is directly proportional to the value of its weight in the Index. The
Index share weights noted above, which are based upon the total shares
outstanding in each of the Index Securities, are additionally subject, in
certain cases, to a rebalancing (see "The Index-Rebalancing of the Index"). The
percentage of the Trust's assets invested in each of the Index Securities is
intended to approximate the percentage each Index Security represents in the
Index.


Rebalancing of the Index

     Effective after the close of trading on December 18, 1998, the Index has
been calculated under a "modified capitalization-weighted" methodology, which
is a hybrid between equal weighting and conventional capitalization weighting.
This methodology is expected to: (1) retain in general the economic attributes
of capitalization weighting; (2) promote portfolio weight diversification
(thereby limiting domination of the Index by a few large

-----------------------

(7)   For example, on December 31, 2003 the aggregate value of the then-current
      Index share weights of each of the Index Securities multiplied by their
      respective last sale price on The Nasdaq Stock Market was $2,219,644,052,
      ABPMV was 189,013,217 on December 31, 2003, the base value was 125, as
      adjusted, at the start of the Index, and the reported Index value was
      1467.92 on December 31, 2003. Please note that the market value and ABPMV
      are in thousands.



                                       57

stocks); (3) reduce Index performance distortion by preserving the
capitalization ranking of companies; and (4) reduce market impact on the
smallest Index Securities from necessary weight rebalancings.

     Under the methodology employed, on a quarterly basis coinciding with
Nasdaq's quarterly scheduled weight adjustment procedures, the Index Securities
are categorized as either "Large Stocks" or "Small Stocks" depending on whether
their current percentage weights (after taking into account such scheduled
weight adjustments due to stock repurchases, secondary offerings, or other
corporate actions) are greater than, or less than or equal to, the average
percentage weight in the Index (i.e., as a 100-stock index, the average
percentage weight in the Index is 1.0%).

     Such quarterly examination will result in an Index rebalancing if either
one or both of the following two weight distribution requirements are not met:
(1) the current weight of the single largest market capitalization Index
Security must be less than or equal to 24.0% and (2) the "collective weight" of
those Index Securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5%,
when added together, must be less than or equal to 48.0%. In addition, Nasdaq
may conduct a special rebalancing if it is determined necessary to maintain the
integrity of the Index.

     If either one or both of these weight distribution requirements are not
met upon quarterly review or Nasdaq determines that a special rebalancing is
required, a weight rebalancing will be performed. First, relating to weight
distribution requirement (1) above, if the current weight of the single largest
Index Security exceeds 24.0%, then the weights of all Large Stocks will be
scaled down proportionately towards 1.0% by enough for the adjusted weight of
the single largest Index Security to be set to 20.0%. Second, relating to
weight distribution requirement (2) above, for those Index Securities whose
individual current weights or adjusted weights in accordance with the preceding
step are in excess of 4.5%, if their "collective weight" exceeds 48.0%, then
the weights of all Large Stocks will be scaled down proportionately towards
1.0% by just enough for the "collective weight," so adjusted, to be set to
40.0%.

     The aggregate weight reduction among the Large Stocks resulting from
either or both of the above rescalings will then be redistributed to the Small
Stocks in the following iterative manner. In the first iteration, the weight of
the largest Small Stock will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal
to the average Index weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller
remaining Small Stocks will be scaled up by the same factor reduced in relation
to each stock's relative ranking among the Small Stocks such that the smaller
the Index Security in the ranking, the less the scale-up of its weight. This is
intended to reduce the market impact of the weight rebalancing on the smallest
component securities in the Index.


                                       58
<PAGE>

     In the second iteration, the weight of the second largest Small Stock,
already adjusted in the first iteration, will be scaled upwards by a factor
which sets it equal to the average index weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of
the smaller remaining Small Stocks will be scaled up by this same factor
reduced in relation to each stock's relative ranking among the Small Stocks
such that, once again, the smaller the stock in the ranking, the less the
scale-up of its weight.

     Additional iterations will be performed until the accumulated increase in
weight among the Small Stocks exactly equals the aggregate weight reduction
among the Large Stocks from rebalancing in accordance with weight distribution
requirement (1) and/or weight distribution requirement (2).

     Then, to complete the rebalancing procedure, once the final percent
weights of each Index Security are set, the Index share weights will be
determined anew based upon the last sale prices and aggregate capitalization of
the Index at the close of trading on the Thursday in the week immediately
preceding the week of the third Friday in March, June, September, and December.
Changes to the Index share weights will be made effective after the close of
trading on the third Friday in March, June, September, and December and an
adjustment to ABPMV will be made to ensure continuity of the Index.

     Ordinarily, new rebalanced weights will be determined by applying the
above procedures to the current Index share weights. However, Nasdaq may from
time to time determine rebalanced weights, if necessary, by instead applying
the above procedure to the actual current market capitalization of the Index
components. In such instances, Nasdaq would announce the different basis for
rebalancing prior to its implementation.

                                       60

     The Sponsor's aim in designing Nasdaq-100 Shares was to provide investors
with a security whose initial market value would approximate one-fortieth
(1/40th) the value of the Index. The market price of a Nasdaq-100 Share may be
affected by supply and demand, market volatility, sentiment, and other factors
(see "Special Considerations and Risk Factors"). Note also, that due to these
factors as well as other factors, including required distributions for tax
purposes (see "Tax Status of the Trust") or the sale of Securities to meet
Trust expenses in excess of the dividends received on the Securities (see
"Expenses of the Trust"), the one-fortieth (1/40th) relationship between the
initial value of a Nasdaq-100 Share and the value of the Index is not expected
to persist indefinitely.

     There can be no assurance that Nasdaq-100 Shares will always be listed on
the Amex. The Amex will consider the suspension of trading in or removal from
listing of Nasdaq-100 Shares: (a) if the Trust has more than 60 days remaining
until termination and there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial holders
of Nasdaq-100 Shares for 30 or more consecutive trading days; (b) if the Index
is no longer calculated or available; or (c) if such other event shall occur or
condition exists which, in the opinion of the Amex, makes further dealings on
the Amex inadvisable.

     The Trust will be terminated in the event that Nasdaq-100 Shares are
delisted from the Amex and are not subsequently relisted on a national
securities exchange or a quotation medium operated by a national securities
association (see "Administration of the Trust--Termination").


                            TAX STATUS OF THE TRUST

     For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Trust qualified for tax
treatment as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Code.
The Trust intends to continue to so qualify. To qualify as a regulated
investment company, the Trust must, among other things, (a) derive in each
taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, gains
from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies,
or certain other sources, (b) meet certain diversification tests, and (c)
distribute in each year at least 90% of its investment company taxable income.
If the Trust qualifies as a regulated investment company, subject to certain
conditions and requirements, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
tax to the extent its income is distributed in a timely manner. Any
undistributed income may be subject to tax, including a four percent (4%)
excise tax imposed by section 4982 of the Code on certain undistributed income
of a regulated investment company that does not distribute to shareholders in a
timely manner at least ninety-eight percent (98%) of its taxable income
(including capital gains).

Tax Consequences to Beneficial Owners

     Any net dividends paid by the Trust from its investment company taxable
income (which includes dividends, interest, and the excess of net short-term
capital gains over net long-term capital losses) will be taxable to Beneficial
Owners as ordinary income. Non-corporate holders, however, will be eligible for
a special 15% maximum tax rate for qualified dividend income through 2008 to
the extent the Trust's dividends are designated by the Trust as attributable to
qualified dividend income received by the Trust (generally, dividends received
by the Trust from domestic corporations and certain foreign corporations). A
net dividend, if any, paid in January will be considered for federal income tax
purposes to have been paid by the Trust and received by Beneficial Owners on
the preceding December 31 if the net dividend was declared in the preceding
October, November, or December to Beneficial Owners of record shown on the
records of the DTC and the DTC Participants (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only
System") on a date in one of those months.

     Distributions paid by the Trust from the excess of net long-term capital
gains over net short-term capital losses ("net capital gain") are taxable as
long-term capital gain, regardless of the length of time an investor has owned
Nasdaq-100 Shares. Any loss on the sale or exchange of a Nasdaq-100 Share held
for six months or less may be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent
of any capital gain dividends received by the Beneficial Owner. For corporate
investors, net dividends from net investment income (but not return of capital
distributions or capital gain dividends) generally will qualify for the
corporate dividends-received deduction to the extent of qualifying dividend
income received by the Trust, subject to the limitations contained in the Code.
Investors should note that the quarterly net dividends paid by the Trust, if
any, will not be based on the Trust's investment company taxable income and net
capital gain, but rather will be based on the dividends paid with respect to
the Securities net of accrued expenses and liabilities of the Trust. As a
result, a portion of the distributions of the Trust may be treated as a return
of capital or a capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes or the
Trust may make additional distributions in excess of the yield performance of
the Securities in order to distribute all of its investment company taxable
income and net capital gain.

     Distributions in excess of the Trust's current or accumulated earnings and
profits (as specially computed) generally will be treated as a return of
capital for federal income tax purposes and will reduce a Beneficial Owner's
tax basis in Nasdaq-100 Shares. Return of capital distributions may result, for
example, if a portion of the net dividends, if any, declared represents cash
amounts deposited in connection with Portfolio Deposits rather than dividends
actually received by the Trust. Under certain circumstances, a significant


                                       62
<PAGE>

portion of any quarterly net dividends of the Trust could be treated as return
of capital distributions. Such circumstances may be more likely to occur in
periods during which the number of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares fluctuates
significantly, as may occur during the initial years of the Trust. Beneficial
Owners will receive annual notification from the Trustee through the DTC
Participants as to the tax status of the Trust's distributions (see "The
Trust--
Book-Entry-Only System"). A distribution, if any, paid shortly after a purchase
or creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares may be taxable even though in effect it may
represent a return of capital.

     The sale of Nasdaq-100 Shares by a Beneficial Owner is a taxable event,
and may result in a gain or loss, which generally should be a capital gain or
loss for Beneficial Owners that are not dealers in securities.

     Under the Code, an in-kind redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares will not result
in the recognition of taxable gain or loss by the Trust but generally will
constitute a taxable event for the redeeming shareholder. Upon redemption, a
Beneficial Owner generally will recognize gain or loss measured by the
difference on the date of redemption between the aggregate value of the cash
and securities received and its tax basis in the Nasdaq-100 Shares redeemed.
Securities received upon redemption (which will be comprised of the securities
portion of the Portfolio Deposit in effect on the date of redemption) generally
will have an initial tax basis equal to their respective market values on the
date of redemption. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") may assert that
any resulting loss may not be deducted by a Beneficial Owner on the basis that
there has been no material change in such Beneficial Owner's economic position
or that the transaction has no significant economic or business utility apart
from the anticipated tax consequences. Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares
in Creation Unit size aggregations should consult their own tax advisors as to
the consequences to them of the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     Net dividend distributions, capital gains distributions, and capital gains
from sales or redemptions may also be subject to state, local and foreign
taxes.

     Deposit of a Portfolio Deposit with the Trustee in exchange for Nasdaq-100
Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations will not result in the recognition of
taxable gain or loss by the Trust but generally will constitute a taxable event
to the depositor under the Code, and a depositor generally will recognize gain
or loss with respect to each security deposited equal to the difference between
the amount realized in respect of the security and the depositor's tax basis
therein. The amount realized with respect to a security deposited should be
determined by allocating the value on the date of deposit of the Nasdaq-100
Shares received (less any cash paid to the Trust, or plus any cash received
from the Trust, in connection with the deposit) among the securities deposited
on the basis of their respective fair market values at


                                       63
<PAGE>

that time. The IRS may assert that any resulting losses may not be deducted by
a depositor on the basis that there has been no material change in the
depositor's economic position or that the transaction has no significant
economic or business utility or purpose apart from the anticipated tax
consequences. Depositors should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences to them of a deposit to the Trust.

     The Trustee has the right to reject the order to create Creation Units
transmitted to it by the Distributor if the depositor or group of depositors,
upon obtaining the Nasdaq-100 Shares ordered, would own eighty percent (80%) or
more of the outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares, and if pursuant to section 351 of
the Code such a circumstance would result in the Trust having a basis in the
securities deposited different from the market value of such securities on the
date of deposit. The Trustee has the right to require information regarding
Nasdaq-100 Share ownership pursuant to the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement and
from the DTC and to rely thereon to the extent necessary to make the foregoing
determination as a condition to the acceptance of a Portfolio Deposit.

     Ordinary income dividends received via DTC by Beneficial Owners who are
nonresident aliens will be subject to a thirty percent (30%) United States
withholding tax unless a reduced rate of withholding or a withholding exemption
is provided under applicable tax treaties. Nonresident shareholders are urged
to consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of United States
withholding tax.

     Backup withholding at a current rate of 28% will apply to dividends,
capital gain distributions, redemptions and sales of Nasdaq-100 Shares unless
(a) the Beneficial Owner is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt
categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact, or (b) provides a
taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from
backup withholding, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment
to a Beneficial Owner will be allowed as a credit against the holder's U.S.
federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund from the
IRS, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.

     The tax discussion set forth above is included for general information
only. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning
the federal, state, local, and foreign tax consequences to them of an
investment in the Trust, including the effect of possible legislative changes.

                             ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

     In considering the advisability of an investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares,
fiduciaries of pension, profit sharing, or other tax-qualified retirement plans
(including Keogh Plans) and welfare plans (collectively, "Plans") subject to
the fiduciary responsibility requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), should consider whether an
investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares is permitted by the documents and instruments
governing the Plan and whether the investment satisfies the exclusive benefit,
prudence, and diversification requirements of ERISA. Individual retirement
account ("IRA") investors should consider that an IRA may make only such
investments as are authorized by its governing instruments.

     The fiduciary standards and prohibited transactions rules of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code will not apply to transactions involving the Trust's
assets while Nasdaq-100 Shares are held by a Plan or IRA. Unlike many other
investment vehicles offered to Plans and IRAs, the Trust's assets will not be
treated as "plan assets" of the Plans or IRAs which acquire or purchase
Nasdaq-100 Shares. Although ERISA imposes certain duties on Plan fiduciaries
and ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions
involving "plan assets" between Plans or IRAs and their fiduciaries or certain
related persons, those rules will not apply to transactions involving the
Trust's assets because Nasdaq-100 Shares represent an interest in the Trust,
and the Trust is registered as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). ERISA, the Code, and U.S.
Department of Labor regulations contain unconditional language exempting the
assets of registered investment companies from treatment as "plan assets" in
applying the fiduciary and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the
Code.

     Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section
3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA)
and foreign plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to
the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. The fiduciaries of
governmental plans should, however, consider the impact of their respective
state pension codes on investments in the Nasdaq-100 Shares and the
considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable.


                   CONTINUOUS OFFERING OF NASDAQ-100 SHARES

     Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations are offered
continuously to the public by the Trust through the Distributor and are
delivered upon the deposit of a Portfolio Deposit (see "The Trust--Procedures
for Creation of Creation Units"). Persons making Portfolio Deposits and
creating Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares will receive no
fees, commissions, or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind


                                       65
<PAGE>

from the Sponsor or the Distributor, nor will any such person have any
obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or Distributor to effect any sale
or resale of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Sponsor reserves
the right, in its sole discretion, to periodically reimburse in whole or in
part the Transaction Fees paid by eligible entities in connection with the
creation or redemption of certain lot-sizes of Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     Because new Nasdaq-100 Shares can be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Trust a "distribution," as such term
is used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), may
be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some
activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their
being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them
statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and
liability provisions of the Securities Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm
or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units
after placing a creation order with the Distributor, breaks them down into the
constituent Nasdaq-100 Shares, and sells the Nasdaq-100 Shares directly to its
customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new
Nasdaq-100 Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of
secondary market demand for Nasdaq-100 Shares. A determination of whether one
is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances
pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the
particular case, and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a
complete description of all the activities that could lead to categorization as
an underwriter.

     Dealers who are not "underwriters" but are participating in a distribution
(as contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions), and thus dealing
with Nasdaq-100 Shares that are part of an "unsold allotment" within the
meaning of Section 4(3)(C) of the Securities Act, would be unable to take
advantage of the prospectus-delivery exemption provided by Section 4(3) of the
Securities Act.

     The Sponsor intends to market Nasdaq-100 Shares through broker-dealers who
are members of the NASD. Investors intending to create or redeem Creation Unit
size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares in transactions not involving a
broker-dealer registered in such investor's state of domicile or residence
should consult counsel regarding applicable broker-dealer or securities
regulatory requirements under such state securities laws prior to such creation
or redemption.

                             EXPENSES OF THE TRUST

     Until the Sponsor determines otherwise, the Sponsor has undertaken that
the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust will not be permitted to exceed
0.20% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust. If the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust exceed such 0.20% level, the Sponsor will
reimburse the Trust or assume invoices on behalf of the Trust for such excess
ordinary operating expenses. The Sponsor retains the ability to be repaid by
the Trust for expenses so reimbursed or assumed to the extent that subsequently
during the fiscal year expenses fall below the 0.20% per annum level on any
given day. Ordinary operating expenses of the Trust do not include taxes,
brokerage commissions, and such extraordinary nonrecurring expenses as may
arise, including without limitation the cost of any litigation to which the
Trust or Trustee may be a party. The Sponsor may discontinue its undertaking to
limit ordinary operating expenses of the Trust or renew this undertaking for an
additional period of time, or may choose to reimburse or assume certain Trust
expenses in later periods in order to keep Trust expenses at a level lower than
what would reflect ordinary operating expenses of the Trust, but is not
obligated to do so. In any event, it is possible that, on any day and during
any period over the life of the Trust, total fees and expenses of the Trust may
exceed 0.20% per annum.

     Subject to any applicable cap, the Sponsor reserves the right to charge
the Trust a special sponsor fee from time to time in reimbursement for certain
services it may provide to the Trust which would otherwise be provided by the
Trustee in an amount not to exceed the actual cost of providing such services.
The Sponsor or the Trustee from time to time may voluntarily assume some
expenses or reimburse the Trust so that total expenses of the Trust are
reduced, although neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is obligated to do so and
either one or both parties may discontinue such voluntary assumption of
expenses or reimbursement at any time without notice.

     The following charges are or may be accrued and paid by the Trust: (a) the
Trustee's fee as discussed more fully below; (b) fees payable to transfer
agents for the provision of transfer agency services; (c) fees of the Trustee
for extraordinary services performed under the Trust Agreement; (d) various
governmental charges; (e) any taxes, fees, and charges payable by the Trustee
with respect to Nasdaq-100 Shares (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations
or otherwise); (f) expenses and costs of any action taken by the Trustee or the
Sponsor to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of Beneficial Owners
of Nasdaq-100 Shares (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or otherwise);
(g) indemnification of the Trustee or the Sponsor for any losses, liabilities
or expenses incurred by them in the administration of the Trust without gross
negligence, bad faith, wilful misconduct, or wilful malfeasance on their part
or reckless disregard of their obligations and duties;


                                       67
<PAGE>

(h) expenses incurred in contacting Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares
during the life of the Trust and upon termination of the Trust; (i) brokerage
commissions incurred by the Trustee when acquiring or selling Index Securities
pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement; and (j) other out-of-pocket
expenses of the Trust incurred pursuant to actions permitted or required under
the Trust Agreement.

     In addition to the specific expenses discussed in the previous paragraph,
the following expenses are or may be charged to the Trust: (a) reimbursement to
the Sponsor of amounts paid by it to Nasdaq in respect of annual licensing fees
pursuant to the License Agreement, (b) federal and state annual registration
fees for the issuance of Nasdaq-100 Shares, and (c) expenses of the Sponsor
relating to the printing and distribution of marketing materials describing
Nasdaq-100 Shares and the Trust (including, but not limited to, associated
legal, consulting, advertising, and marketing costs and other out-of-pocket
expenses such as printing). Pursuant to the provisions of an exemptive order,
the expenses set forth in this paragraph may be charged to the Trust by the
Trustee in an amount equal to the actual costs incurred, but in no case shall
such charges exceed 20/100 of 1% (0.20%) per annum of the daily net asset value
of the Trust.

     If income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other
distributions on the Securities is insufficient to cover Trust fees and
expenses, the Trustee will sell Securities in an amount sufficient to pay the
excess of accrued fees and expenses over the dividends and other Trust accrued
income. Specifically, the Trustee will ordinarily be required to sell
Securities whenever the Trustee determines that projected annualized fees and
expenses accrued on a daily basis exceed projected annualized dividends and
other Trust income accrued on a daily basis by more than 1/100 of one percent
(0.01%) of the net asset value of the Trust. Whenever the 0.01% threshold is
exceeded, the Trustee will sell sufficient Securities to cover such excess no
later than the next occasion it is required to make adjustments to the
Portfolio due to a Misweighting (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the
Portfolio"), unless the Trustee determines, in its discretion, that such a sale
is unnecessary because the cash to be generated is not needed by the Trust at
that time for the payment of expenses then due or because the Trustee otherwise
determines that such sale is not warranted or advisable. At the time of the
sale, the Trustee shall first sell Securities that are over-weighted in the
Portfolio as compared to their relative weighting in the Index.

     The Trustee may also make advances to the Trust to cover expenses. The
Trustee may reimburse itself in the amount of any such advance, plus any
amounts required by the Federal Reserve Board which are related to such
advances, together with interest thereon at a percentage rate equal to the
then-current overnight federal funds rate, by deducting such amounts from

                                       68
<PAGE>


(1) dividend payments or other income of the Trust when such payments or other
income is received, (2) the amounts earned or benefits derived by the Trustee
on cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust, and (3) the sale of
Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any advance
remains outstanding for more than forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee
shall ordinarily sell Securities to reimburse itself for the amount of such
advance and any accrued interest thereon. Such advances, as well as rights of
the Trustee to the payment of its fee, reimbursement of expenses and other
claims, will be secured by a lien upon and a security interest in the assets of
the Trust in favor of the Trustee. The expenses of the Trust are reflected in
the net asset value of the Trust (see "Valuation").


     For services performed under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is paid by
the Trust a fee at an annual rate of 4/100 of 1% to 10/100 of 1% of the net
asset value of the Trust, as shown below, such percentage amount to vary
depending on the net asset value of the Trust. Such compensation is computed on
each Business Day on the basis of the net asset value of the Trust on such day,
and the amount thereof is accrued daily and paid monthly. The Trustee, in its
discretion, may waive all or a portion of such fee. Notwithstanding the fee
schedule set forth in the table below, the Trustee shall be paid a minimum
annual fee of $180,000 per annum. To the extent that the amount of the
Trustee's compensation is less than such minimum annual fee, the Sponsor has
agreed to pay the amount of any such shortfall.

                                   VALUATION

     The NAV of the Trust is computed as of the Evaluation Time shown under
"Summary-Essential Information" on each Business Day. The NAV of the Trust on a
per Nasdaq-100 Share basis is determined by subtracting all liabilities
(including accrued expenses and dividends payable) from the total value of the
Trust's investments and other assets and dividing the result by the total
number of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares.

                                       69
<PAGE>

     The aggregate value of the Securities shall be determined by the Trustee
in good faith in the following manner. The value of a Security shall generally
be based on the closing sale price for the Security on that day (unless the
Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) on The Nasdaq
Stock Market or, if there is no such appropriate closing sale price on The
Nasdaq Stock Market, at the closing bid price (unless the Trustee deems such
price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation). If a Security is not so quoted
on The Nasdaq Stock Market or, if so quoted and the principal market therefor
is other than on The Nasdaq Stock Market or there is no such closing bid price
available, such evaluation shall generally be made by the Trustee in good faith
based (a) on the closing price for the Security on another market on which the
Security is traded, if available, or otherwise based on the closing sale price
on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the last day that the security traded (unless the
Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) or if there
is no such appropriate closing price, at the closing bid price on such other
market, (b) on current bid prices on The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other
markets, (c) if bid prices are not available, on the basis of current bid
prices for comparable securities, (d) by the Trustee's appraising the value of
the Securities in good faith on the bid side of the market, or (e) by any
combination thereof.

                          ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST

Distributions to Beneficial Owners


     The regular quarterly ex-dividend date with respect to net dividends, if
any, for Nasdaq-100 Shares is the third Friday in each of March, June,
September, and December, unless such day is not a Business Day, in which case
the ex-dividend date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. Beneficial
Owners as reflected on the records of the DTC and the DTC Participants on the
second Business Day following the ex-dividend date (the "Record Date") are
entitled to receive an amount, if any, representing dividends accumulated on the
Securities through the quarterly Accumulation Period which ends on the Business
Day preceding such ex-dividend date (including Securities with ex-dividend dates
falling within such quarterly dividend period) and other income, if any,
received by the Trust, net of the fees and expenses of the Trust, accrued daily
for such period. For the purposes of such distributions, dividends per
Nasdaq-100 Share are calculated at least to the nearest 1/100th of $0.01.
However, there shall be no net dividend distribution in any given quarter, and
any net dividend amounts will be rolled into the next Accumulation Period, if
the aggregate net dividend distribution would be in an amount less than 5/100 of
one percent (0.05%) of the net asset value of the Trust as of the Friday in the
week immediately preceding the ex-dividend date, unless the Trustee determines
that such net dividend distribution is required to be made in order to maintain
the Trust's


                                       70
<PAGE>


status as a regulated investment company or to avoid the imposition of income
or excise taxes on undistributed income (see "Tax Status of the Trust"). When
net dividend payments are to be made by the Trust, payment will be made on the
last Business Day in the calendar month following each ex-dividend date (the
"Dividend Payment Date").


     Dividends payable to the Trust in respect of the Securities are credited
by the Trustee to a non-interest bearing account as of the date on which the
Trust receives such dividends. Other moneys received by the Trustee in respect
of the Securities, including but not limited to the Cash Component, the Cash
Redemption Amount, all moneys realized by the Trustee from the sale of options,
warrants, or other similar rights received or distributed in respect of the
Securities as dividends or distributions and capital gains resulting from the
sale of Securities, are also credited by the Trustee to a non-interest bearing
account. All funds collected or received are held by the Trustee without
interest until distributed or otherwise utilized in accordance with the
provisions of the Trust Agreement. To the extent the amounts credited to such
accounts generate interest income or an equivalent benefit to the Trustee, such
interest income or benefit is used to reduce any charges made in connection
with advances made by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust to cover Trust
expenses in those cases when the Trust income is insufficient to pay such
expenses when due (see "Expenses of the Trust").

     The Trust has qualified, and intends to continue to qualify, as a
regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes. A regulated
investment company is not subject to federal income tax on its net investment
income and capital gains that it distributes to shareholders, so long as it
meets certain overall distribution and diversification requirements and other
conditions under Subchapter M of the Code. The Trust intends to satisfy these
overall distribution and diversification requirements and to otherwise satisfy
any required conditions. The Trustee intends to make additional distributions
to the minimum extent necessary (i) to distribute the entire annual investment
company taxable income of the Trust, plus any net capital gains (from sales of
securities in connection with adjustments to the Portfolio, payment of the
expenses of the Trust, or to generate cash for such distributions), and (ii) to
avoid imposition of the excise tax imposed by section 4982 of the Code. The
additional distributions, if needed, would consist of (a) any amount by which
estimated Trust investment company taxable income and net capital gains for a
fiscal year exceed the amount of Trust taxable income previously distributed
with respect to such year or, if greater, the minimum amount required to avoid
imposition of such excise tax, and (b) a distribution soon after the actual
annual investment company taxable income and net capital gains of the Trust
have been computed of the amount, if any, by which such actual income exceeds
the distributions already made. The net asset value of the Trust will be
reduced by the amount of such additional distributions. The magnitude of the
additional distributions, if any, will depend upon a number

                                       71
<PAGE>

of factors, including the level of redemption activity experienced by the
Trust. Because substantially all proceeds from the sale of Securities in
connection with adjustments to the Portfolio will have been used to purchase
shares of Index Securities, the Trust may have no cash or insufficient cash
with which to pay any such additional distributions. In that case, the Trustee
typically will have to sell shares of the Securities sufficient to produce the
cash required to make such additional distributions. In selecting the
Securities to be sold to produce cash for such distributions, the Trustee will
choose among the Securities that are over-weighted in the Portfolio relative to
their weighting in the Index first and then from among all other Securities in
a manner so as to maintain the weighting of each of the Securities within the
applicable Misweighting Amount.

     The Trustee may declare special dividends if, in its reasonable
discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve the status of the
Trust as a regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of income or
excise taxes on undistributed income.


     The Trustee may vary the frequency with which periodic distributions, if
any, are to be made from the Trust (e.g., from quarterly to semi-annually) if it
is determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee, in their discretion, that such a
variance would be advisable to facilitate compliance with the rules and
regulations applicable to regulated investment companies or would otherwise be
advantageous to the Trust. In addition, the Trustee reserves the right to change
the regular ex-dividend date for Nasdaq-100 Shares to another regular date if it
is determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee, in their discretion, that such a
change would be advantageous to the Trust. Notice of any such variance or change
(which notice shall include changes to the Record Date, the ex-dividend date,
the Dividend Payment Date, and the Accumulation Period resulting from such
variance) shall be provided to Beneficial Owners via the DTC and the DTC
Participants (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").


     The Trustee may advance out of its own funds any amounts necessary to
permit distributions via the DTC to Beneficial Owners. The Trustee may
reimburse itself in the amount of such advance, together with interest thereon
at a percentage rate equal to the then current overnight federal funds rate,
plus Federal Reserve Bank requirements, by deducting such amounts from (1)
dividend payments or other income of the Trust when such payments or other
income is received, (2) the amounts earned or benefits derived by the Trustee
on cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust, and (3) the sale of
Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any advance
remains outstanding for more than forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee
shall ordinarily sell Securities to reimburse itself for such advance and any
accrued interest thereon. Such advances will be secured by a lien upon and a
security interest in the assets of the Trust in favor of the Trustee.

                                       72
<PAGE>

     In addition, as soon as practicable after notice of termination of the
Trust, the Trustee will distribute via the DTC and the DTC Participants to each
Beneficial Owner redeeming Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations
prior to the termination date specified in such notice, a portion of the
Securities and cash as described above. Otherwise, the Trustee will distribute
to each Beneficial Owner (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or
otherwise), as soon as practical after termination of the Trust, such
Beneficial Owner's pro rata share in cash of the net asset value of the Trust.

     All distributions are made by the Trustee through the DTC and the DTC
Participants to Beneficial Owners as recorded on the book-entry system of the
DTC and the DTC Participants.

     The settlement date for the creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit
size aggregations or the purchase of Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market
must occur on or prior to the Record Date in order for such creator or
purchaser to receive any distributions made by the Trust on the next Dividend
Payment Date. If the settlement date for such creation or a secondary market
purchase occurs after the Record Date, the distribution will be made to the
prior security holder or Beneficial Owner as of such Record Date.

Statements to Beneficial Owners; Annual Reports

     With each distribution, the Trustee will furnish for distribution to
Beneficial Owners (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System") a statement setting
forth the amount being distributed expressed as a dollar amount per Nasdaq-100
Share.

     Promptly after the end of each fiscal year, the Trustee will furnish to
the DTC Participants, for distribution to each person who was a Beneficial
Owner of Nasdaq-100 Shares at the end of such fiscal year, an annual report of
the Trust containing financial statements audited by independent accountants of
nationally recognized standing and such other information as may be required by
applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

Rights of Beneficial Owners


     Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations (i.e., 50,000
Nasdaq-100 Shares) may be tendered to the Trustee for redemption. Beneficial
Owners may sell Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market, but must accumulate
enough Nasdaq-100 Shares (i.e., 50,000 shares) to constitute a full Creation
Unit in order to redeem through the Trust. The death or incapacity of any
Beneficial Owner will not operate to terminate the Trust nor entitle such
Beneficial Owner's legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to
take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the
Trust. By its purchase of a Nasdaq-100 Share, each Beneficial Owner


                                       73
<PAGE>

expressly waives any right he or she may have under law to require the Trustee
at any time to account, in any manner other than as expressly provided in the
Trust Agreement, for the Securities or moneys from time to time received, held,
and applied by the Trustee under the Trust.

     Beneficial Owners shall not (a) have the right to vote concerning the
Trust, except with respect to termination and as otherwise expressly set forth
in the Trust Agreement, (b) in any manner control the operation and management
of the Trust or (c) be liable to any other person by reason of any action taken
by the Sponsor or the Trustee. The Trustee has the right to vote all of the
voting securities in the Trust. The Trustee votes the voting securities of each
issuer in the same proportionate relationship as all other shares of each such
issuer are voted to the extent permissible and, if not permitted, abstains from
voting.

Amendment

     The Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Trustee and
the Sponsor without the consent of any Beneficial Owners (a) to cure any
ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision thereof which may be
defective or inconsistent or to make such other provisions in regard to matters
or questions arising thereunder as will not adversely affect the interests of
Beneficial Owners; (b) to change any provision thereof as may be required by
the Commission; (c) to add or change any provision as may be necessary or
advisable for the continuing qualification of the Trust as a "regulated
investment company" under the Code; (d) to add or change any provision thereof
as may be necessary or advisable in the event that NSCC or the DTC is unable or
unwilling to continue to perform its functions as set forth therein; (e) to add
or change any provision thereof to conform the adjustments to the Portfolio and
the Portfolio Deposit to changes, if any, made by Nasdaq in its method of
determining the Index; (f) to add or change any provision thereof as may be
necessary to implement a dividend reinvestment plan or service; (g) to make
changes to the Transaction Fee and to other amounts charged in connection with
creations and redemptions of Nasdaq-100 Shares within the original parameters
set forth in the Trust Agreement; and (h) to make changes to the level of net
dividends below which a dividend distribution will not be paid in a given
quarter and will instead be rolled into the next Accumulation Period.

     The Trust Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Sponsor
and the Trustee with the consent of the Beneficial Owners of 51% of the
outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares to add provisions to or change or eliminate any
of the provisions of the Trust Agreement or to modify the rights of Beneficial
Owners; provided, however, that the Trust Agreement may not be amended without
the consent of the Beneficial Owners of all outstanding

                                       74
<PAGE>

Nasdaq-100 Shares if such amendment would (1) permit, except in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement, the acquisition of any
securities other than those acquired in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Trust Agreement; (2) reduce the interest of any Beneficial
Owner in the Trust; or (3) reduce the percentage of Beneficial Owners required
to consent to any such amendment.

     Promptly after the execution of any such amendment, the Trustee shall
receive from the DTC, pursuant to the terms of the Depository Agreement, a list
of all DTC Participants holding Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Trustee shall inquire of
each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners for whom such
DTC Participant holds Nasdaq-100 Shares, and provide each such DTC Participant
with sufficient copies of a written notice of the substance of such amendment
for transmittal by each such DTC Participant to such Beneficial Owners.


Termination

     The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor has the discretionary right
to direct the Trustee to terminate the Trust if at any time the net asset value
of the Trust is less than $350,000,000, as such dollar amount shall be adjusted
for inflation in accordance with the CPI-U, such adjustment to take effect at
the end of the fourth year following the Initial Date of Deposit and at the end
of each year thereafter and to be made so as to reflect the percentage increase
in consumer prices as set forth in the CPI-U for the twelve-month period ending
in the last month of the preceding fiscal year.

     The Trust will also terminate in the event that Nasdaq-100 Shares are
delisted from the Amex and are not subsequently relisted on a national
securities exchange or a quotation medium operated by a national securities
association. The Amex will consider the suspension of trading in or the
delisting of Nasdaq-100 Shares as discussed above.


     The Trust may also be terminated (a) by the agreement of the Beneficial
Owners of 66 2/3% of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares; (b) if the DTC is unable or
unwilling to continue to perform its functions as set forth under the Trust
Agreement and a suitable replacement is unavailable; (c) if NSCC no longer
provides clearance services with respect to Nasdaq-100 Shares and a suitable
replacement is unavailable, or if the Trustee is no longer a participant in
NSCC or any successor to NSCC providing clearance services; (d) if Nasdaq
ceases publishing the Index; and (e) if the License Agreement is terminated.
Currently, the License Agreement is scheduled to expire on March 10, 2004 in
accordance with its terms and is subject to a five-year renewal period
following such date. In accordance with the terms of the License Agreement, the
Sponsor has notified Nasdaq of its intention to renew


                                       75
<PAGE>


the License Agreement for another five years or until March 10, 2009. The Trust
will also terminate by its terms on the Mandatory Termination Date.


     If either the Sponsor or the Trustee shall resign or be removed and a
successor is not appointed, the Trust will terminate. The dissolution of the
Sponsor or its ceasing to exist as a legal entity for any cause whatsoever,
however, will not cause the termination of the Trust Agreement or the Trust
unless the Trustee deems termination to be in the best interests of Beneficial
Owners.

     Prior written notice of the termination of the Trust will be given at
least twenty (20) days prior to termination of the Trust to all Beneficial
Owners in the manner described above. The notice will set forth the date on
which the Trust will be terminated (the "Termination Date"), the period during
which the assets of the Trust will be liquidated, the date on which Beneficial
Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or
otherwise) will receive in cash the net asset value of the Nasdaq-100 Shares
held, and the date determined by the Trustee upon which the books of the Trust
shall be closed. Such notice shall further state that, as of the date thereof
and thereafter, neither requests to create additional Creation Units nor
Portfolio Deposits will be accepted, and that, as of the date thereof and
thereafter, the portfolio of Securities delivered upon redemption shall be
essentially identical in composition and weighting to the Securities held in
the Trust as of such date rather than the securities portion of the Portfolio
Deposit as in effect on the date the request for redemption is deemed received.
Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations may,
in advance of the Termination Date, redeem in kind directly from the Trust.

     Within a reasonable period of time after the Termination Date the Trustee
shall, subject to any applicable provisions of law, use its best efforts to
sell all of the Securities not already distributed to redeeming Beneficial
Owners of Creation Units. The Trustee shall not be liable for or responsible in
any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any such sale or sales.
The Trustee may suspend such sales upon the occurrence of unusual or unforeseen
circumstances, including but not limited to a suspension in trading of a
Security, the closing or restriction of trading, the outbreak of hostilities,
or the collapse of the economy. Upon receipt of proceeds from the sale of the
last Security, the Trustee shall deduct therefrom its fees and all other
expenses. The remaining amount shall be transmitted to the DTC for distribution
via the DTC Participants, together with a final statement setting forth the
computation of the gross amount distributed. Nasdaq-100 Shares not redeemed
prior to termination of the Trust will be redeemed in cash at net asset value
based on the proceeds of the sale of the Securities. Such redemptions in cash
at net asset value shall be available to all Beneficial Owners, with no minimum
aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares required.

                                    SPONSOR

     The Sponsor of the Trust is Nasdaq Financial Products Services, Inc.
(formerly, Nasdaq Investment Product Services, Inc.), a Delaware corporation
incorporated on August 7, 1998 with offices c/o The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.,
9513 Key West Avenue, Rockville, MD 20850. The Sponsor's Internal Revenue
Service Employer Identification Number is 52-2115391. Nasdaq owns all of the
Sponsor's outstanding shares of common stock. Nasdaq is a "control person" of
the Sponsor as such term is defined in the Securities Act.

     The Sponsor, at its own expense, may from time to time provide additional
promotional incentives to brokers who sell Nasdaq-100 Shares to the public. In
certain instances, these incentives may be provided only to those brokers who
meet certain threshold requirements for participation in a given incentive
program, such as selling a significant number of Nasdaq-100 Shares within a
specified time period.

     If at any time the Sponsor shall fail to undertake or perform or become
incapable of undertaking or performing any of the duties which by the terms of
the Trust Agreement are required of it to be undertaken or performed, or shall
resign, or shall become bankrupt or its affairs shall be taken over by public
authorities, the Trustee may appoint a successor Sponsor as shall be
satisfactory to the Trustee, agree to act as Sponsor itself, or may terminate
the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust. Notice of the resignation or
removal of the Sponsor and the appointment of a successor shall be mailed by
the Trustee to the DTC and the DTC Participants for distribution to Beneficial
Owners. Upon a successor Sponsor's execution of a written acceptance of such
appointment as Sponsor of the Trust, such successor Sponsor shall become vested
with all of the rights, powers, duties, and obligations of the original
Sponsor. Any successor Sponsor may be compensated at rates deemed by the
Trustee to be reasonable.

     The Sponsor may resign by executing and delivering to the Trustee an
instrument of resignation. Such resignation shall become effective upon the
appointment of a successor Sponsor and the acceptance of such appointment by
the successor Sponsor, unless the Trustee either agrees to act as Sponsor or
terminates the Trust Agreement and liquidates the Trust, which the Trustee
shall do if no successor Sponsor is appointed. The dissolution of the Sponsor
or its ceasing to exist as a legal entity for any reason whatsoever will not
cause the termination of the Trust Agreement or the Trust unless the Trustee
deems termination to be in the best interests of the Beneficial Owners of
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor is not liable to the
Trustee, the Trust, or to the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares for taking
any action or for refraining from taking any action made in good faith

                                       77
<PAGE>

or for errors in judgment, but is liable only for its own gross negligence, bad
faith, wilful misconduct, or wilful malfeasance in the performance of its
duties or its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Trust
Agreement. The Sponsor is not liable or responsible in any way for depreciation
or loss incurred by the Trust by reason of the sale of any Securities of the
Trust. The Trust Agreement further provides that the Sponsor and its directors,
subsidiaries, shareholders, officers, employees, and affiliates under common
control with the Sponsor (each a "Sponsor Indemnified Party") shall be
indemnified from the assets of the Trust and held harmless against any loss,
liability, or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith, wilful
misconduct, or wilful malfeasance on the part of any Sponsor Indemnified Party
in the performance of its duties or reckless disregard of its obligations and
duties under the Trust Agreement, including the payment of the costs and
expenses (including counsel fees) of defending against any claim or liability.

                                    TRUSTEE

     The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a corporation organized under the
laws of the State of New York with trust powers. The Trustee has an office at
101 Barclay Street, New York, NY 10286 and its Internal Revenue Service
Employer Identification Number is 135-160382. The Trustee is subject to
supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New York State Banking
Department.

     Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may resign and be discharged of the
Trust created by the Trust Agreement by executing a notice of resignation in
writing and filing such notice with the Sponsor and mailing a copy of the
notice of resignation to all DTC Participants that are reflected on the records
of the DTC as owning Nasdaq-100 Shares, for distribution to Beneficial Owners
as provided above (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System") not less than sixty
(60) days before the date such resignation is to take effect. Such resignation
will become effective upon the appointment of and the acceptance of the Trust
by a successor Trustee or, if no successor is appointed within sixty (60) days
after the date such notice of resignation is given, the Trust shall terminate
(see "Administration of the Trust--Termination"). The Sponsor, upon receiving
notice of such resignation, is obligated to use its best efforts to appoint a
successor Trustee promptly.

     In case the Trustee becomes incapable of acting as such or is adjudged
bankrupt or is taken over by any public authority, the Sponsor may discharge
the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement.
Notice of such discharge and appointment shall be mailed by the Sponsor to the
DTC and the DTC Participants for distribution to Beneficial

                                       78
<PAGE>

Owners. Upon a successor Trustee's execution of a written acceptance of an
appointment as Trustee for the Trust, such successor Trustee will become vested
with all the rights, powers, duties, and obligations of the original Trustee. A
successor Trustee is required to be a bank, trust company, corporation, or
national banking association organized and doing business under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof, to be authorized under such laws to
exercise corporate trust powers, and to have at all times an aggregate capital,
surplus, and undivided profit of not less than $50,000,000.

     Beneficial Owners of 51% of the then outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares may at
any time remove the Trustee by written instrument(s) delivered to the Trustee
and the Sponsor. The Sponsor shall thereupon use its best efforts to appoint a
successor Trustee in the manner specified above and in the Trust Agreement.

     The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee is not liable for any action
taken in reasonable reliance on properly executed documents or for the
disposition of moneys or Securities or for the evaluations required to be made
thereunder, except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith, wilful
malfeasance, wilful misconduct, or reckless disregard of its duties and
obligations, nor is the Trustee liable or responsible in any way for
depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any
Securities in the Trust. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act, the
Trustee may act and is not liable for any such action taken by it in good
faith. The Trustee is not personally liable for any taxes or other governmental
charges imposed upon or in respect of the Securities or upon the interest
thereon or upon it as Trustee or upon or in respect of the Trust which the
Trustee may be required to pay under any present or future law of the United
States of America or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In
addition, the Trust Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the
liability of the Trustee. The Trustee and its directors, subsidiaries,
shareholders, officers, employees, and affiliates under common control with the
Trustee (each a "Trustee Indemnified Party") will be indemnified from the
assets of the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, or expense
incurred without gross negligence, bad faith, wilful misconduct, wilful
malfeasance on the part of such Trustee Indemnified Party, or reckless
disregard of its duties and obligations, arising out of, or in connection with
its acceptance or administration of the Trust, including the costs and expenses
(including counsel fees) of defending against any claim or liability.

securities transactions by their respective employees. Subject to certain
conditions and standards, the code permits employees to invest in the

fraud, deception and misconduct against the Trust and to provide reasonable
standards of conduct. The code is on file with the Commission and you may

                 INFORMATION AND COMPARISON RELATING TO TRUST,
                   SECONDARY MARKET TRADING, NET ASSET SIZE,
                        PERFORMANCE, AND TAX TREATMENT

     Information regarding various aspects of the Trust, including the net
asset size thereof, as well as the secondary market trading, the performance,
and the tax treatment of Nasdaq-100 Shares, may be included from time to time
in advertisements, sales literature, and other communications as well as in
reports to current or prospective Beneficial Owners. Any such
performance-related information will reflect only past performance of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, and no guarantees can be made of future results.

     Information may be provided to prospective investors to help such
investors assess their specific investment goals and to aid in their
understanding of various financial strategies. Such information may present
current economic and political trends and conditions and may describe general
principles of investing such as asset allocation, diversification, and risk
tolerance, as well as specific investment techniques such as indexing and
hedging. In addition, information may be presented to prospective or current
Beneficial Owners regarding the purchase of Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary
market, such as margin requirements, types of orders that may be entered, and
information concerning short sales. Similarly, market data symbols, trading
fractions, other trading information, and the CUSIP number relating to
Nasdaq-100 Shares may be included in such information. Comparisons with other
investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, may be made with respect to the
application of such requirements, costs of fund management and administration,
costs and advantages of intraday trading, and rules applicable to short sales.

     Information regarding the Trust's net asset size may be stated in
communications to prospective or current Beneficial Owners for one or more time
periods, including annual, year-to-date, or daily periods. Such information may
also be expressed in terms of the total number of Nasdaq-100 Shares outstanding
as of one or more time periods. Factors integral to the size of the Trust's net
assets, such as creation volume and activity, may also be discussed and may be
specified from time to time or with respect to various periods of time.
Comparisons of such information during various periods may also be made and may
be expressed by means of percentages.

     Information may be provided to investors regarding the ability to engage
in short sales of Nasdaq-100 Shares, including reference to any applicable
exemption from the "tick test" provision of the Commission's "short sale rule"
(Rule 10a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), to permit short sales
on "minus" or "zero-minus" ticks. Selling short refers to the sale of
securities which the seller does not own, but which the seller arranges to
borrow prior to effecting the sale. Institutional investors may be advised that
lending their

                                       81
<PAGE>

Nasdaq-100 Shares to short sellers may generate stock loan credits which may
supplement the return they can earn from an investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares.
These stock loan credits may provide a useful source of additional income for
certain institutional investors who can arrange to lend Nasdaq-100 Shares.
Potential short sellers may be advised that a short rebate (functionally
equivalent to partial use of proceeds of the short sale) may reduce their cost
of selling short.

     Information may be provided to investors regarding capital gains
distributions by the Trust, including historical information relating to such
distributions. Comparisons between the Trust and other investment vehicles such
as mutual funds may be made regarding such capital gains distributions, as well
as relative tax efficiencies between the Trust and such other investment
vehicles (e.g., realization of capital gains or losses to the Trust and to such
other investment vehicles in connection with redemption of their respective
securities). (See "Tax Status of the Trust" for discussion of tax consequences
to Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in connection with the sale or
redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares.) Based on projected differences between
Nasdaq-100 Shares and conventional mutual funds with regard to capital gains
distributions, projections may be made regarding comparative capital gains
distributions and tax rates for taxable investors holding Nasdaq-100 Shares
over a long period of time. Comparisons may also be provided regarding the
probable tax impact resulting from rebalancing of the Trust portfolio (see "The
Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio") and adjustments to the portfolio of
an actively managed investment vehicle.


     Specifically, information may be provided to prospective or current
investors comparing and contrasting the tax efficiencies of conventional mutual
funds with Nasdaq-100 Shares. Both conventional mutual funds and the Trust may
be required to recognize capital gains incurred as a result of adjustments to
the composition and weighting of the Index and therefore to their respective
portfolios. From a tax perspective, however, a significant difference between a
conventional mutual fund and the Trust is the process by which their shares are
redeemed. In cases where a conventional mutual fund experiences redemptions in
excess of subscriptions ("net redemptions") and has insufficient cash available
to fund such net redemptions, such fund may have to sell stocks held in its
portfolio to raise and pay cash to redeeming shareholders. A mutual fund will
generally experience a taxable gain or loss when it sells such portfolio stocks
in order to pay cash to redeeming fund shareholders. In contrast, the
redemption mechanism for Nasdaq-100 Shares does not ordinarily involve selling
the Securities held by the Trust in the event of a redemption. Instead, the
Trust delivers an actual portfolio of securities in an "in-kind" exchange to
any person redeeming Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations
(i.e., 50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares per Creation Unit). While this "in-kind"
exchange is a taxable transaction to the redeeming


                                       82
<PAGE>

entity (usually a broker/dealer) making the exchange, it generally does not
constitute a taxable transaction at the Trust level and, consequently, there is
no realization of taxable gain or loss by the Trust with respect to such
"in-kind" exchanges. In a period of market appreciation of the Index and,
consequently, appreciation of Nasdaq-100 Shares, this "in-kind" redemption
mechanism has the effect of eliminating the recognition and distribution of
those net unrealized gains at the Trust level. Investors should note that
although the same result would occur for conventional mutual funds utilizing an
"in-kind" redemption mechanism, the opportunities to redeem fund shares by
delivering portfolio stocks "in-kind" are limited in most mutual funds.

     Investors may be informed that, while no unequivocal statement can be made
as to the net tax impact on a conventional mutual fund resulting from the
purchases and sales of its portfolio stocks over a period of time, conventional
funds that have accumulated substantial unrealized capital gains, if they
experience net redemptions and do not have sufficient available cash, may be
required to make taxable capital gains distributions that are generated by
changes in such fund's portfolio. In contrast, the "in-kind" redemption
mechanism of Nasdaq-100 Shares may make them more tax efficient investments
under most circumstances than comparable conventional mutual fund shares. As
discussed above, this "in-kind" redemption feature of the Trust tends to lower
the amount of annual net capital gains distributions to Nasdaq-100 Shareholders
as compared to their conventional mutual fund counterparts. Since shareholders
are generally required to pay income tax on capital gains distributions, the
smaller the amount of such distributions, the less taxes that are payable
currently. To the extent that the Trust is not required to recognize capital
gains, the Nasdaq-100 Shareholder is able, in effect, to defer tax on such
gains until he sells or otherwise disposes of his shares, or the Trust
terminates. If such holder retains his shares until his death, under current
law the tax basis of such shares would be adjusted to their then fair market
value.

     Information regarding the secondary market trading activity of Nasdaq-100
Shares also may be presented over one or more stated time periods, such as for
daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual periods. Nasdaq-100 Share secondary market
trading volume information may be compared with similar information relating to
other issues trading on the Amex during the same reporting period. Average
daily secondary market trading volume of Nasdaq-100 Shares may also be reported
from time to time. Comparisons of such information during various periods may
also be made, and may be expressed by means of percentages.

     Information may also be provided in communications to prospective
investors or current Beneficial Owners comparing and contrasting the relative
advantages of investing in Nasdaq-100 Shares as compared to other investment
vehicles, such as mutual funds, both on an individual and

                                       83
<PAGE>

a group basis (e.g., stock index mutual funds). Such information may include
comparisons of costs and expense ratios, expressed either in dollars or basis
points, stock lending activities, permitted investments and hedging activities
(e.g., engaging in options or futures transactions), and portfolio turnover
data and analyses. In addition, such information may quote, reprint, or include
portions of financial, scholarly, or business publications or periodicals,
including model allocation schedules or portfolios, as the foregoing relate to
the comparison of Nasdaq-100 Shares to other investment vehicles, current
economic, financial and political conditions, investment philosophy or
techniques, or the desirability of owning Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     In addition, information on the performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares on the
basis of changes in price per Nasdaq-100 Share with or without reinvesting all
dividends, if any, and/or any distributions of capital in additional Nasdaq-100
Shares may be included from time to time in such information. Average
annualized performance may be stated for various periods. Total return figures
may also be stated for a period from the Initial Date of Deposit, a date at
least twelve months prior to the end of the reporting period or for annual
periods for the life of the Trust. Total return measures the percentage growth
in the total dollar value of an investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares (reflecting
dividends, if any, and capital appreciation but without provision for any
income taxes payable).

     Information on the Index contained in this Prospectus, as updated from
time to time, may also be included from time to time in such material. The
performance of the Trust, of the Index (provided information is also given
reflecting the performance of the Trust in comparison to the Index) or both may
also be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in market
surveys such as SEI Fund Evaluation Survey (a leading database of tax-exempt
funds) or mutual funds such as those reported by Lipper Analytical Services
Inc., Money Magazine Fund Watch, Wiesenberger Investment Companies Service,
Morningstar Incorporated, and Value Line Investment Survey, each of which
measures performance following their own specific and well-defined calculation
measures, or of the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock
Exchange Composite Index, the Nasdaq Composite Index (indices of stocks traded
on the New York and American Stock Exchanges and The Nasdaq Stock Market,
respectively), the S&P 500 Index[RegTM] (a broad-based index of 500 publicly
traded companies), the S&P MidCap 400 IndexTM (a broad-based index of 400
publicly traded middle capitalization companies), the Dow Jones Industrial
AverageSM (an index currently comprising 30 publicly traded large
capitalization companies), or similar domestic or foreign measurement standards
during the same period of time. In addition to all other sources of comparative
information, comparative performance figures published by other funds or money
managers may be included from time to time. Information may also be included
regarding the aggregate amount of assets committed to index

                                       84
<PAGE>

investing generally by various types of investors, such as pension funds and
other institutional investors, which currently exceeds $300 billion.


     Information on the relative price performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
relation to other securities and/or indices may be represented in the form of
"correlation." Correlation is a standard measure of the degree of linear
association between two price series, and ranges from minus one hundred percent
(-100%) (i.e., perfect negative linear association) to positive one hundred
percent (+100%) (i.e., perfect positive linear association).


     One important difference between Nasdaq-100 Shares and conventional mutual
fund shares is that Nasdaq-100 Shares are available for purchase or sale on an
intraday basis on the Amex. An investor who buys shares in a conventional
mutual fund will usually buy or sell shares at a price at or related to the
closing net asset value per share, as determined by the fund. In contrast,
Nasdaq-100 Shares are not offered for purchase or redeemed for cash at a fixed
relationship to closing NAV. The tables below illustrate the distribution
relationships of daily pricing data for Nasdaq-100 Shares, NAV and the
Nasdaq-100 Index for the 2003 calendar year. These tables may help investors
compare the trading costs and intraday trading risks of Nasdaq-100 Shares to
funds sold and redeemed at prices related to closing NAV.

     Investors who purchase or sell Nasdaq-100 Shares may wish to evaluate the
volatility of the price of Nasdaq-100 Shares during the trading day. To assist
investors in making such an evaluation, the Daily Percentage Price Range table
illustrates the volatility of price movements for both Nasdaq-100 Shares and
the Nasdaq-100 Index on a daily basis. Investors who purchase or sell
Nasdaq-100 Shares may also wish to evaluate the opportunity to buy or sell on
an intraday basis versus the assurance of a transaction at or related to
closing NAV. To assist investors in making this comparison, the High and Low
Price versus Closing Value table illustrates the possibility of buying or
selling Nasdaq-100 Shares at prices less or more favorable than closing NAV.

     Investors may wish to evaluate the potential of Nasdaq-100 Shares to
approximate the value of the assets in the Trust as a basis of valuation of the
shares. The Closing Price versus NAV table illustrates the closing value of
Nasdaq-100 Shares in relation to the underlying value of the assets in the
Trust on a daily basis. Additionally, the NAV versus Nasdaq-100 Index table
shows the difference between the underlying value of assets in the Trust and
the Nasdaq-100 Index based on month-end values.

     Finally, investors may wish to consider the average bid/asked spread on
Nasdaq-100 Shares, as illustrated in the Bid/Asked Spread table, and add any
commissions charged by a broker to determine the direct costs of trading
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

     The information provided in the following tables with respect to the
Nasdaq-100 Shares (including price ranges, relationship of prices to closing
NAV, and bid/asked spreads) may vary materially over time. There is some
evidence, for example, that the bid/asked spread will widen in more volatile
markets and narrow when markets are less volatile.

     The price range of Nasdaq-100 Shares for the 2003 calendar year was from
$23.32 to $36.64.

     Information relating to the relative price performance of Nasdaq-100
Shares may be compared against a wide variety of investment categories and
asset classes, including common stocks, small capitalization stocks, long and
intermediate-term corporate and government bonds, Treasury bills, the rate of
inflation in the United States (based on the Consumer Price Index ("CPI")) and
combinations of various capital markets. Historical returns of these and other
capital markets in the United States may be provided by independent statistical
studies and sources, such as those provided by Ibbotson Associates of Chicago,
Illinois. The performance of these capital markets is based on the returns of
different indices. Information may be presented using the performance of these
and other capital markets to demonstrate general investment strategies. For
example, the performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares may be compared to the
performance of selected asset classes such as short-term U.S. Treasury bills,
long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, long-term corporate bonds, mid-capitalization
stocks, foreign stocks, and small capitalization stocks and may also be
measured against the rate of inflation as set forth in well-known indices (such
as the CPI). Performance comparisons may also include the value of a
hypothetical investment in any of these capital markets. Performance of
Nasdaq-100 Shares may also be compared to that of other indices or compilations
that may be developed and made available to the investing public in the future.
Of course, such comparisons will only reflect past performance of Nasdaq-100
Shares and the investment categories, indices, or compilations chosen, and no
guarantees can be made of future results regarding the performance of either
Nasdaq-100 Shares or the asset classes chosen for such comparisons.
