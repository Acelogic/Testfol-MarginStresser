                        NASDAQ-100 INDEX TRACKING STOCK
                         PROSPECTUS PART A--HIGHLIGHTS

NASDAQ-100 SHARES ARE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE NASDAQ-100 TRUST

    The Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust that
issues securities called Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock (also referred to in
this Prospectus as "Nasdaq-100 Shares"). Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock
represents undivided ownership interests in the portfolio of stocks held by the
Trust. The Trust holds all of the common stocks of the Nasdaq-100
Index-Registered Trademark- (the "Index") and is intended to provide investment
results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield
performance of the Index.

NASDAQ-100 SHARES TRADE ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE

    Nasdaq-100 Shares are listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange (the
"Amex"). Nasdaq-100 Shares are bought and sold in the secondary market like
ordinary shares of stock at any time during the trading day. Nasdaq-100 Shares
generally trade in round lots of 100 shares, but can be traded in odd lots of as
little as one share. Trading of Nasdaq-100 Shares on the Amex may be halted
under the circumstances described in the paragraphs below relating to the risks
of investing in Nasdaq-100 Shares.

THE NASDAQ-100 TRUST ISSUES AND REDEEMS NASDAQ-100 SHARES IN MULTIPLES OF 50,000
SHARES CALLED "CREATION UNITS"

    The Trust issues Nasdaq-100 Shares only in blocks of 50,000 or multiples of
50,000, which are referred to as "Creation Units." Most investors, however,
purchase and sell Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary trading market on the Amex,
in lots of any size.

    Creation Units are issued by the Trust to anyone who, after placing a
creation order with the Distributor, deposits with The Bank of New York, the
"Trustee" of the Trust, a specified portfolio of Nasdaq-100 Index securities, as
well as a cash payment, if any, generally equal to accumulated dividends of the
securities (net of expenses) up to the time of deposit.

    Nasdaq-100 Shares are not individually redeemable, except upon termination
of the Trust. Nasdaq-100 Shares can be redeemed only by tendering to the Trust
50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares or multiples thereof. Upon redemption, the redeeming
holder will receive a portfolio of Nasdaq-100 Index securities based on the net
asset value of the Trust plus, in some cases, a cash payment. The cash payment
amount is generally equal to the cash amount determined for creations of

                                      A-1
<Page>
Nasdaq-100 Shares and, likewise, may be paid by either the redeeming holder or
the Trust, depending on the values of the dividends received, Trust expenses and
the adjustment amount.

    Procedures to be followed when engaging in creation and redemption
transactions are set forth in Part B of this Prospectus.

    A person placing a creation order or requesting a redemption must pay a
$1,000 to $4,000 order fee to the Trustee, depending on the method chosen. No
fee is payable for secondary market purchases or sales of Nasdaq-100 Shares, but
secondary market transactions are subject to ordinary brokerage commissions.

NASDAQ-100 SHARES SHOULD CLOSELY TRACK THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING NASDAQ-100
INDEX STOCKS

    To maintain the correspondence between the composition and weights of
securities held by the Trust (the "Securities") and the stocks in the Nasdaq-100
Index, the Securities will be adjusted by the Trustee from time to time to
conform to periodic changes in the identity and/or relative weights of
Nasdaq-100 Index stocks. The agreement governing the Trust contains directions
to the Trustee as to how changes to the Nasdaq-100 Index are to be replicated by
the Trust.

    The value of the Nasdaq-100 Shares will fluctuate in relation to changes in
the value of the Trust's portfolio of securities. However, at any point in time,
the market price of each individual Nasdaq-100 Share may not be identical to the
net asset value of such share. Historically, these two valuations have been very
close. See Part B of this Prospectus for comparisons of market price and net
asset value. Of course, these comparisons only reflect past performance and no
guarantee can be made of future performance.

    The current value of the Nasdaq-100 Index will ordinarily continue to be
reported even when trading is interrupted in its component stocks. In that
event, the reported Index level will be based on the current market price of
those stocks still being traded (if any) and the last reported prices for those
stocks that are not currently trading. As a result, reported Index levels may at
times be based on non-current price information with respect to some or even all
of the stocks in the Nasdaq-100 Index.

EXPENSES OF THE TRUST


    Fees and expenses to be charged to the Trust are described in Part B of this
Prospectus and include, among other costs, the Trustee's fees, Nasdaq licensing
fees, federal registration fees and expenses of the


                                      A-2
<Page>

Sponsor relating to the printing and distribution of marketing materials. The
expenses of the Trust will be accrued daily and reflected in the net asset value
of the Trust. Pursuant to a letter agreement with the Trustee, the Trustee has
agreed to contribute towards the marketing or other promotion of the Trust and
the Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Sponsor has undertaken that, for the period effective
October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2002, the ordinary operating expenses of
the Trust will not exceed 0.20% per annum of the daily net asset value of the
Trust, and the Sponsor will reimburse the Trust for expenses incurred by it in
excess of such amount.

(1) Based on the net asset value of the Trust of $58.40 per Share on
    December 31, 2000.


(2) The Trustee's annual fee ranges from 0.04% to 0.10%, based on the net asset
    value of the Trust.


(3) Marketing expenses include direct advertising in print and television media,
    and the cost of production of such advertising, consultant fees and
    prospectus printing expenses.


(4) The Sponsor had undertaken that for the period through the Trust's fiscal
    year ending September 30, 2001, the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust
    as calculated by the Trustee would not be permitted to exceed an amount
    which, on a per-annum basis, is 0.18% of the net asset value of the Trust.
    The Sponsor has undertaken that for the period effective October 1, 2001
    through September 30, 2002 the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust will
    not be permitted to exceed 0.20% per annum of the daily net asset value of
    the Trust. Gross expenses of the Trust for the year ending September 30,
    2001, without regard to this undertaking, are estimated to be 0.19% of the
    net asset value of the Trust. The gross expenses of the Trust for the year
    ended September 30, 2000, if the Sponsor had not undertaken to limit the
    expenses of the Trust to


                                      A-3
<Page>

    0.18%, would have been 0.19%, as disclosed in footnote (2) to the financial
    highlights of the Trust. After September 30, 2002, the Sponsor may, in its
    sole discretion, discontinue its undertaking to limit ordinary operating
    expenses of the Trust or renew this undertaking for an additional period of
    time, and, if renewed, such 0.20% level may be changed and may exceed 0.20%.
    See "Expenses of the Trust."



    Future accruals will depend primarily on the level of the Trust's net assets
and the level of expenses. There is no guarantee that after September 30, 2002
the Trust's ordinary operating expenses will not exceed 0.20% of the Trust's
daily net asset value. The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue its
reimbursement policy in the future.


Example of Expenses:


    An investor would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment,
assuming the estimated operating expense ratio cap of 0.20% set forth in
footnote (4) above for the year ending September 30, 2002, but not for later
years, and assuming estimated operating expenses thereafter without the
foregoing 0.20% expense cap are the same as the estimated gross expense for the
year ending September 30, 2002 and a 5% annual return on investment throughout
the periods.


    Cumulative Expenses Paid for Period of:

</Table>


    The above example assumes the reinvestment of all dividends and
distributions and utilizes a 5% annual rate of return as mandated by Securities
and Exchange Commission regulations applicable to mutual funds. Although the
Trust is a unit investment trust rather than a mutual fund, this information is
presented to permit a comparison of fees. The example should not be considered a
representation of past or future expenses or annual rate of return; the actual
expenses and annual rate of return may be more or less than those assumed for
purposes of this example. Investors should also note that the presentation of a
$1,000 investment is for illustration purposes only. Pursuant to an exemptive
order obtained from the Securities and Exchange Commission the Trust may
reimburse the Sponsor for certain expenses relating to the printing and
distribution of marketing materials describing the Nasdaq-100 Shares and the
Trust, reimbursement to the Sponsor for annual licensing fees and federal and
state annual registration fees for the issuance of Nasdaq-100 Shares up to 0.20%
(20 basis points) of the Trust's total assets.

THE TRUSTEE VOTES THE UNDERLYING SHARES

    The Trustee will vote any voting stocks held by the Trust in the same
proportion as all other voting shares of such stocks are voted. Consequently,
holders of Nasdaq-100 Shares will not be able to vote the shares of the stocks
underlying the Nasdaq-100 Shares.

TERMINATION OF THE NASDAQ-100 TRUST

    The Trust has a specified lifetime term. The Trust is scheduled to terminate
no later than March 4, 2124, but it may terminate earlier under circumstances
described in Part B of this Prospectus.

    Trading of Nasdaq-100 Shares cannot occur after the underlying Trust is
terminated. Upon termination, the Trust may be liquidated and holders of
Nasdaq-100 Shares at that time will receive a distribution of their pro rata
share of the assets of the Trust, net of certain fees and expenses.

RISK FACTORS

    Investors can lose money by investing in Nasdaq-100 Shares. Investors should
carefully consider the risk factors described below together with all of the
other information included in Part B of this Prospectus before deciding to
invest in Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    - Nasdaq-100 Shares are subject to the risks of any investment in a broadly
      based portfolio of common stocks, including the risk that the general
      level of stock prices may decline. A significant decline in the value of
      the Trust's portfolio can be expected to result in a similar decline in
      value of the corresponding Nasdaq-100 Shares. Therefore, the amount an
      investor receives from the sale of Nasdaq-100 Shares may be less than the
      investor's original purchase price.

    - The Trust may never be able to replicate exactly the performance of the
      Nasdaq-100 Index because of the operational fees and expenses incurred by
      the Trust or because of the temporary unavailability of certain Nasdaq-100
      Index securities.

    - Investors cannot be assured that the issuers of securities held by the
      Trust will pay dividends. Distributions on such securities will generally
      depend upon the declaration of dividends by the securities' issuers, but
      it is likely for the present and possibly for extended periods of time
      that Trust expenses will exceed any such dividends.

                                      A-5
<Page>
    - The market price that an investor pays for Nasdaq-100 Shares on the Amex
      may differ from the net asset value of those Nasdaq-100 Shares. This
      difference in price may be due to the fact that the supply and demand in
      the market for Nasdaq-100 Shares at any point in time is not always
      identical to the supply and demand in the market for the underlying basket
      of Nasdaq-100 Index securities.

    - Investors will not be able to sell Nasdaq-100 Shares during any period
      that the Amex halts trading in the Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Amex may halt
      the trading of Nasdaq-100 Shares under circumstances described in Part B
      of this Prospectus (for example, as a result of the activation of
      market-wide "circuit breakers," or whenever Amex officials determine that
      a halt is appropriate in the interest of a fair and orderly market or to
      protect investors).

    - Nasdaq-100 Shares are subject to the risk of an investment in a portfolio
      of equity securities in economic sectors in which the Index may be highly
      concentrated (e.g., technology) and therefore subject to price volatility
      with respect to the Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    - The Sponsor of the Trust has been granted a license to use the Nasdaq-100
      Index as a basis for determining the composition of the Trust and to use
      certain trade names and trademarks of Nasdaq. The Trust may be terminated
      if the license agreement is terminated.

NASDAQ-100 TRUST SERIES I
REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

----------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE SPONSOR, TRUSTEE AND THE UNITHOLDERS OF THE NASDAQ-100 TRUST, SERIES 1:


    We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments of the Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 (the
"Trust") as of September 30, 2000, and the related statements of operations,
statements of changes in net assets and financial highlights for the year then
ended and for the period March 5, 1999 (commencement of operations) to
September 30, 1999. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's Sponsor, Nasdaq Investment Product Services, Inc.
(the "Sponsor"). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.


    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2000 by correspondence with
the Trust's custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and the financial highlights
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 at September 30, 2000, and the
results of its operations, changes in its net assets and its financial
highlights for the year then ended and for the period March 5, 1999
(commencement of operations) to September 30, 1999, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NASDAQ-100 TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2000

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. ORGANIZATION

    Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created
under the laws of the state of New York and registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the
opportunity to purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing
proportionate undivided interests in the portfolio of securities held by the
Trust consisting of substantially all of the securities, in substantially the
same weighting, as the component securities of the Nasdaq-100 Index.

    The Trust commenced operations on March 5, 1999 upon the initial issuance of
150,000 shares of the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock (equivalent to three
Creation Units) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect
the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of
significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION

    Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on The
Nasdaq Stock Market which is deemed to be the principal market for the security.
If no closing sale price is available, then the security is valued at the mean
between the closing bid and asked prices on The Nasdaq Stock Market. If there
are no closing bid and asked prices available, valuation will be determined by
the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

    Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on

                                      A-14
<Page>
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
a specific identification basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend
date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS

    The Trust will declare and distribute dividends, if any, from net investment
income quarterly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if any,
at least annually. Distributions would only occur in the event that dividends
accumulated and other income received by the Trust, exceed Trust fees and
expenses during such period.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX

    The Trust has qualified and intends to continue to qualify for and elect
treatment as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By so qualifying the Trust will not be subject
to federal income taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income,
including any net realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by
distributing during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment
income and capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal
excise tax. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance
with income tax regulations which may differ from accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatment for in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash
sales. During 2000, the Trust reclassified $3,755,118,927 of nontaxable security
gains realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation Units as an increase to
paid in surplus in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The Trust incurred
net capital losses of $493,093,045 for the year ended September 30, 2000. For
tax purposes the Trust has capital loss carryforwards of $18,036,354 and
9,472,938 that expire in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

3. TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR

    The Trust pays the expenses of its operation, including the fees of its
Trustee and reimbursement to Nasdaq Investment Product Services, Inc. (the
"Sponsor") for payments to The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") for a
license to use the Nasdaq-100 Index as a basis for determining the composition
and weighting of securities held by the Trust. Nasdaq paid the fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the

3. TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR (CONTINUED)
organization of the Trust and its registration as an investment company, and
such expenses were not borne by the Trust.

    In accordance with the Trust Agreement, The Bank of New York (the "Trustee")
maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and transfer agent
to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including filing of all
required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for determining the
composition of the portfolio of securities which must be delivered in exchange
for the issuance of Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the
composition of the Trust's portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in
the composition and/or weighting structure of the Nasdaq-100 Index. For these
services, the Trustee receives a fee at the following annual rates:

<Table>

      NET ASSET VALUE         FEE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET
        OF THE TRUST           ASSET VALUE OF THE TRUST

$2,500,000,000-and above*     6/100 of 1% per annum
</Table>

*   The fee indicated applies to that portion of the net asset value of the
    Trust which falls in the size category indicated.

    The minimum annual fee which shall be paid to the Trustee is $180,000. Any
shortfall between the Trustee fee computed per the above table and the minimum
annual fee will be paid by the Sponsor.

    The Sponsor has undertaken that on each day during each fiscal year up to
and including the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, the ordinary operating
expenses of the Trust as calculated by the Trustee will not be permitted to
exceed an amount which is 18/100 of one percent (0.18%) per annum of the daily
net asset value of the Trust. To the extent during such period that ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust do exceed such 0.18% amount, the Sponsor will
reimburse the Trust or assume invoices on behalf of the Trust for such excess
ordinary operating expenses. The Sponsor retains the ability to be repaid by the
Trust for expenses so reimbursed or assumed to the extent that subsequently
during the fiscal year expenses fall below the 0.18% per annum level on any
given day. For the year ended September 30, 2000, ordinary operating expenses
incurred by the Trust exceeded the 0.18% per annum

Trust.

    In addition, $4,203,865 of expenses paid by the Sponsor on behalf of the
Trust for invoices received directly by the Sponsor during the year were repaid
to the Sponsor in November 2000.

4. TRUST TRANSACTIONS IN SHARES OF THE NASDAQ-100 INDEX TRACKING STOCK

    On February 11, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Sponsor approved a

to equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. The transaction fee charged in connection with creation or
redemption of Creation Units through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is $1,000

    The Nasdaq-100 Trust, Series 1 was formed by Nasdaq Financial Products
Services, Inc. (formerly Nasdaq Investment Product Services, Inc.), a Delaware
corporation (the "Sponsor") and a wholly owned subsidiary of The Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq"), to provide investors with the opportunity to purchase
units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate undivided
interests in the portfolio of Securities held by the Trust, which consist of
substantially all of the securities, in substantially the same weighting, as the
component securities of the Nasdaq-100 Index-Registered Trademark-.* While the
investment objective of the Trust is to provide investment results that
generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Index, there is
no assurance that this investment objective can be fully achieved. The units of
fractional undivided interest in the Trust are called "Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking
Stock(SM)" and for convenience are referred to in this prospectus as "Nasdaq-100
Shares(SM)".* The value of the Securities and, consequently, the value of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, will fluctuate. The minimum number of Nasdaq-100 Shares that
may be created or redeemed at any one time as described below is 50,000, which
aggregation is referred to herein as a "Creation Unit."


    Nasdaq-100 Shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange. The market

                               PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

      THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE MORE DETAILED
  INFORMATION APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS.

  OBJECTIVES

      The Sponsor formed the Trust to provide investors with the opportunity
  to purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing
  proportionate undivided interests in the Securities, which consist of
  substantially all of the securities, in substantially the same weighting, as
  the component securities of the Nasdaq-100 Index-Registered Trademark- in
  the form of a security that closely tracks the Index and that may be traded
  as a share of common stock. The investment objective of the Trust is to
  provide investment results that generally correspond to the price and yield
  performance of the component securities of the Index (the component
  securities of the Index are sometimes referred to herein as "Index
  Securities"). There can be no assurance that this investment objective will
  be met fully. For example, it may not be possible for the Trust to replicate
  and maintain exactly the composition of the Index Securities. It is also
  possible that, from time to time, the Trust will be unable to purchase all
  of the Index Securities. In certain circumstances, the Trust may also be
  required to make distributions in excess of the yield performance of the
  Index Securities (see "Tax Status of the Trust"). The value of the
  Securities and, consequently, the value of Nasdaq-100 Shares, are subject to
  changes in the value of common stocks generally and to other factors.
  Further, the payment, if any, of dividends (net of Trust fees and expenses)
  and the maintenance of capital are subject to a number of conditions,
  including the financial condition of the issuers of the Securities (see
  "Special Considerations and Risk Factors").

  THE TRUST


      The Trust is a unit investment trust organized under the laws of the
  State of New York. The Trust is governed by a trust agreement (the "Trust
  Agreement") between The Bank of New York, a corporation organized under the
  laws of the State of New York with trust powers (the "Trustee"), and the
  Sponsor, dated and executed as of March 4, 1999, as amended by Amendment
  No. 1 to the Trust Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2001.


                                      B-2

  DISTRIBUTOR

      The Distributor for Nasdaq-100 Shares is ALPS Mutual Funds
  Services, Inc., a registered broker-dealer and a member of the National
  Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (see "Underwriting").

  PORTFOLIO DEPOSITS

      All orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size
  aggregations must be placed with the Distributor (see "Underwriting" and
  "The Trust--Procedures for Creation of Creation Units"). To be eligible to
  place orders with the Distributor to create Creation Unit size aggregations
  of Nasdaq-100 Shares, an entity or person either must be (1) a
  "Participating Party", as hereinafter defined or (2) a Depository Trust
  Company Participant (see "Book Entry Ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares"), and
  in each case must have executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement, as
  hereinafter defined (see "The Trust--Procedures for Creation of Creation
  Units" and "The Trust--Placement of Creation Orders Using the Nasdaq-100
  Clearing Process"). As used herein, the term "Participating Party" means a
  broker-dealer or other participant in the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, as
  hereinafter defined, through the Continuous Net Settlement ("CNS") System of
  the National Securities Clearing Corporation ("NSCC"), a clearing agency
  that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
  "Commission").(*) Upon acceptance of an order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares,
  the Distributor will transmit such order to the Trustee and instruct the
  Trustee to initiate the book entry movement of the appropriate number of
  Nasdaq-100 Shares to the account of the entity placing the order. Payment
  for orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares will be made by deposits with the
  Trustee of a portfolio of securities that is substantially similar in

  *   As of June 30, 2001, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
      Inc. (the "NASD") beneficially owned (including shares owned directly by
      the Amex) approximately 8.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of
      common stock of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ("DTCC"),
      the parent company of NSCC and the Depository, and the NASD owned 10,000
      shares of preferred stock of DTCC, which entitles the NASD to elect one
      director of DTCC. The NASD is currently the majority owner of Nasdaq.

  composition and weighting to the Index Securities (see "The Trust--Creation
  of Nasdaq-100 Shares"), together, in certain cases, with a cash payment in
  an amount which shall be equal to the Income Net of Expense Amount (as
  hereinafter defined), plus or minus, as the case may be, the Balancing
  Amount (as hereinafter defined). The "Income Net of Expense Amount" is an
  amount equal, on a per Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on all the
  Securities with ex-dividend dates within the period beginning on the most
  recent ex-dividend date for Nasdaq-100 Shares (generally, the third Friday
  in each of March, June, September, and December, see "Distributions")

  expenses and liabilities for such period not previously deducted (including,
  without limitation, (x) taxes or other governmental charges against the
  Trust not previously deducted, if any, and (y) accrued fees of the Trustee
  and other expenses of the Trust (including legal and auditing expenses) and
  other expenses not previously deducted (see "Expenses of the Trust")). The
  "Balancing Amount" serves the function of compensating for any differences
  between (1) the value of the portfolio of securities deposited with the
  Trustee in connection with a creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares, together with
  the Income Net of Expense Amount, and (2) the net asset value of the Trust
  on a per Creation Unit basis (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the
  Portfolio Deposit" for a further description thereof).

      The Income Net of Expense Amount and the Balancing Amount are
  collectively referred to herein as the "Cash Component" and the deposit of
  such a portfolio of securities and the Cash Component are collectively
  referred to herein as a "Portfolio Deposit." In connection with an order to
  create Nasdaq-100 Shares on any given day, the Cash Component of the
  Portfolio Deposit may be payable either by the Trustee on behalf of the
  Trust to the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares or by the creator of Nasdaq-100
  Shares to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, depending upon the respective
  amounts of the Income Net of Expense Amount and the Balancing Amount. For
  example, if the sum of dividends on all Securities with ex-dividend dates
  within the Accumulation Period, plus or minus the Balancing Amount, exceeds
  the accrued expenses and liabilities of the Trust for such period (I.E., the
  Cash Component has a positive value), then the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares
  will be obligated to pay such amount to the

                                      B-4
<Page>
  Trustee on behalf of the Trust in connection with an order to create
  Nasdaq-100 Shares. Conversely, if the sum of dividends on all Securities
  with ex-dividend dates within the Accumulation Period, plus or minus the
  Balancing Amount, is less than the accrued expenses and liabilities of the
  Trust for such period (I.E., the Cash Component has a negative value), then
  the Trustee on behalf of the Trust will pay such Cash Component to the
  entity placing an order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares.

      All matters as to the number of shares of each of the Index Securities
  and the amount of the Cash Component comprising the Portfolio Deposit shall
  be determined by the Trustee in its discretion, whose determination shall be
  final and binding. In certain instances, the securities portion of the
  Portfolio Deposit may differ in composition and weighting relative to the
  composition and weighting of the securities in the Index. For example, in
  connection with the creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares, in the event that the
  Trustee determines, in its discretion, that one or more Index Securities are
  likely to be unavailable for delivery or available in insufficient quantity
  for delivery to the Trust upon the creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation
  Unit size aggregations, then the Trustee shall have the right in its
  discretion to permit the cash equivalent value of such Index Security or
  Index Securities to be included in the Portfolio Deposit in the calculation
  of the Cash Component in lieu of the inclusion of such Index Security or
  Index Securities in the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit (see
  "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit").

      Similarly, in connection with the creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares, if a
  creator is restricted by regulation or otherwise from investing or engaging
  in a transaction in one or more Index Securities, the Trustee shall have the
  right, in its discretion, to permit the cash equivalent value of such Index
  Security or Index Securities to be included in the Portfolio Deposit, based
  on the market value of such Index Security or Index Securities as of the
  Evaluation Time on the date such creation order is deemed received by the
  Distributor, in the calculation of the Cash Component in lieu of the
  inclusion of such Index Security or Index Securities in the securities
  portion of the Portfolio Deposit. In such case the creator will pay the
  Trustee the standard Transaction Fee described below, plus an additional
  amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one
  Creation Unit.

                                      B-5
<Page>
      An entity or person placing creation orders with the Distributor must
  either (i) initiate instructions pertaining to Portfolio Deposits through
  the CNS clearing processes of NSCC, as such processes have been enhanced to
  effect creations and redemptions of Creation Unit size aggregations of
  Nasdaq-100 Shares, such processes being referred to herein as the
  "Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process", or (ii) deposit Portfolio Deposits with the
  Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process (I.E., through the
  facilities of The Depository Trust Company).

  TRANSACTION FEE

      A transaction fee is payable to the Trustee in connection with each
  creation and each redemption made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process of
  Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares (the "Transaction
  Fee"), subject to the changes, modifications or waivers, if any, described
  below. Such Transaction Fee is non-refundable, regardless of the net asset
  value of the Trust.


      Until further notice is given as described below, the Transaction Fee
  charged in connection with each creation of Creation Units through the
  Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process (see "The Trust--Procedures for Creation of
  Creation Units") is (i) $500 per Participating Party per day for creations
  of Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares where there are
  also, in the same day, separate creations in any number, or redemptions in
  an amount not equal to the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares created, of other
  similar exchange traded funds based on the Index for which the Trustee or
  its affiliate acts as trustee, fund administrator or in any similar
  capacity, (ii) no fee per Participating Party where there is, in the same
  day, a redemption of an equal number of shares of another similar exchange
  traded fund based on the Index for which the Trustee or its affiliate acts
  as the trustee, fund administrator or in any similar capacity, and (iii) in
  all other cases $1,000 per Participating Party per day, regardless of the
  number of Creation Units created on such day by such Participating Party.
  Likewise, until further notice is given as described below, the Transaction
  Fee charged in connection with the redemption of Creation Units through the
  Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is (i) $500 per Participating Party per day for
  redemption of Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares where
  there are also, in the same day, separate redemptions in any number, or
  creations in an amount not equal to the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares
  redeemed,


                                      B-6
<Page>

  of another similar exchange traded fund based on the Index for which the
  Trustee or its affiliate acts as trustee, fund administrator or in any
  similar capacity, (ii) no fee per Participating Party where there is, in the
  same day, a creation of an equal number of shares of another similar
  exchange traded fund based on the Index for which the Trustee or its
  affiliate acts as the trustee, fund administrator or in any similar
  capacity, and (iii) in all other cases $1,000 per Participating Party per
  day, regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed on such day by such
  Participating Party. This Transaction Fee may subsequently be changed by the
  Trustee, upon the consent of the Sponsor, but will not in any event exceed
  10/100 of one percent (10 basis points) of the value of a Creation Unit at
  the time of creation or redemption as the case may be (the "10 Basis Point
  Limit"). No modifications to, or reductions, discounts or waivers of, the
  Transaction Fee charged in connection with the creation of Creation Units
  are scheduled or currently contemplated by the Sponsor or the Trustee.



      If Creation Units are created or redeemed outside the Nasdaq-100
  Clearing Process, an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the
  applicable Transaction Fee will be charged to the creator or redeemer. Under
  the current schedule, therefore, the total fee charged in connection with
  the creation or redemption of Creation Units outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
  Process would be (i) $500 per Participating Party per day for creations of
  Creation Unit size aggregtions of Nasdaq-100 Shares where there are also, in
  the same day, separate creations in any number, or redemptions in an amount
  not equal to the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares created, of other similar
  exchange traded funds based on the Index for which the Trustee or its
  affiliate acts as trustee, fund administrator or in any similar capacity,
  (ii) no fee per Participating Party where there is, in the same day, a
  redemption of an equal number of shares of another similar exchange traded
  fund based on the Index for which the Trustee or its affiliate acts as the
  trustee, fund administrator or in any similar capacity and (iii) in all
  other cases $1,000 (the Transaction Fee for the creation or redemption of a
  Creation Unit) plus an additional amount not to exceed $3,000 (3 times
  $1,000) for a total of $4,000.


      From time to time, and for such periods as the Sponsor and the Trustee
  together may determine, the Transaction Fee (as well as any additional
  amounts charged in connection with creations and/or redemptions outside the
  Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process) may be

                                      B-7
<Page>
  increased, decreased, or otherwise modified or waived in its entirety for
  certain numbers of Creation Units of Nasdaq-100 Shares created or redeemed,
  or for creations and/or redemptions made under certain specified
  circumstances, in each case without the consent of Beneficial Owners,
  subject to certain conditions (see "The Trust--Creation of Creation Units"
  and "The Trust--Procedures for Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares"). The
  Sponsor also reserves the right, from time to time, to vary the number of
  Nasdaq-100 Shares per Creation Unit (currently 50,000 shares) and such
  change may or may not be made in conjunction with a change to the
  Transaction Fee. Any change to the Transaction Fee so made will not cause
  the amount of the Transaction Fee to exceed the 10 Basis Point Limit at the
  time of a creation or redemption, as the case may be. Such changes or
  variations will be effected by an amendment to the current Trust prospectus.
  The amount of the Transaction Fee in effect at any given time will be
  available from the Trustee.

  SIZE OF CREATION UNIT AGGREGATIONS OF NASDAQ-100 SHARES

      Nasdaq-100 Shares may be created or redeemed only in Creation Unit size
  aggregations of 50,000 shares, or in multiples thereof (E.G., 100,000,
  150,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares), and in no event will fractional Creation Units
  be created or redeemed. The Sponsor reserves the right to direct the Trustee
  to declare a split or reverse split in the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares
  outstanding in the event that the per Nasdaq-100 Share price in the
  secondary market changes to an amount that the Sponsor believes falls
  outside a desirable retail range. The Sponsor also reserves the right to
  make a corresponding change in the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares constituting
  a Creation Unit. For example, if a 2-for-1 split were declared and the
  Sponsor also determined to make a corresponding change in the number of
  Nasdaq-100 Shares per Creation Unit, the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares in a
  Creation Unit size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares would double (E.G., from
  50,000 to 100,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares). The Sponsor has determined not to make
  a corresponding change in the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares constituting a
  Creation Unit in connection with the 2-for-1 stock split effected on
  March 20, 2000.

                                      B-8
<Page>
  PORTFOLIO ADJUSTMENTS


      To maintain the correspondence between the composition and weighting of
  Securities held in the Trust and that of the Index Securities, the
  composition and weighting of the Securities are adjusted from time to time
  to conform to periodic changes in the composition and weighting of the Index
  Securities made by Nasdaq. The Trustee aggregates certain of these
  adjustments and makes conforming changes to the Trust's portfolio at least
  monthly; adjustments are made more frequently, however, in the case of
  changes to the Index that are significant (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments
  to the Portfolio"). The composition and weighting of the securities portion
  of a Portfolio Deposit are also adjusted to conform to changes in the Index.
  Any change in the identity or weighting of an Index Security will result in
  a corresponding adjustment to the prescribed Portfolio Deposit generally
  effective on the Business Day (a "Business Day" being any day that The
  Nasdaq Stock Market is open for business) on which the change to the Index
  takes effect or shortly thereafter. Changes to the Index are made after the
  close of the market (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio
  Deposit").


  BOOK-ENTRY OWNERSHIP OF NASDAQ-100 SHARES

      The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, a limited purpose
  trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York (referred to
  herein as "DTC" or the "Depository") or its nominee will be the record or
  registered owner of all outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares. Beneficial ownership
  of Nasdaq-100 Shares will be shown on the records of the Depository or its
  participants. Certificates will not be issued for Nasdaq-100 Shares, whether
  in Creation Unit size aggregations or otherwise (see "The
  Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").

  EXPENSES

      The Trustee's fees and other expenses of the Trust are described more
  fully below in "Expenses of the Trust." If the income received by the Trust
  in the form of dividends and other distributions on the Securities is
  insufficient to cover Trust fees and expenses (which is currently the case),
  then the Trustee will be required to sell Securities in an amount sufficient
  to pay the shortfall. Such a sale of Securities will ordinarily be required
  to

                                      B-9
<Page>
  occur whenever the Trustee determines that projected annualized fees and
  expenses accrued on a daily basis exceed projected annualized dividends and
  other Trust income accrued on a daily basis by more than 1/100 of one
  percent (0.01%) of the net asset value of the Trust and will ordinarily be
  made no later than the next occurring adjustment to the Securities held in
  the Trust to conform to changes in the composition and weighting of the
  Index Securities (see "Expenses of the Trust" and "The
  Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio").

  FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

      The Trust's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. The Trust has
  elected tax treatment as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M
  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
  distributes annually its entire investment company taxable income and
  capital gain. Distributions that are taxable as ordinary income to
  Beneficial Owners generally are expected to constitute dividend income for
  federal income tax purposes and to be eligible for the dividends-received
  deduction available to many corporations to the extent of qualifying
  dividend income received by the Trust (see "Tax Status of the Trust"). The
  quarterly distributions, if any, made by the Trust will be based on the
  dividend performance of the Securities held during such quarterly
  distribution period, net of Trust fees and expenses, rather than the actual
  taxable income of the Trust. (See "Administration of the
  Trust--Distributions to Beneficial Owners.") As a result, a portion of any
  such distributions of the Trust may be treated as a return of capital or a
  capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes or the Trust may be
  required to make additional distributions to maintain its status as a
  regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of income or excise
  taxes on undistributed income (see "Tax Status of the Trust" and
  "Administration of the Trust--Distributions to Beneficial Owners").

  ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

      In considering the advisability of an investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares,
  fiduciaries of pension, profit sharing, or other tax-qualified retirement
  plans (including Keogh Plans) and welfare plans (collectively, "Plans")
  subject to the fiduciary responsibility requirements of the Employee
  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), should
  consider whether an

                                      B-10
<Page>
  investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares is permitted by the documents and
  instruments governing the Plan and whether the investment satisfies the
  exclusive benefit, prudence, and diversification requirements of ERISA.
  Individual retirement account ("IRA") investors should consider that an IRA
  may make only such investments as are authorized by its governing
  instruments.

      The fiduciary standards and prohibited transactions rules of ERISA and
  Section 4975 of the Code will not apply to transactions involving the
  Trust's assets while Nasdaq-100 Shares are held by a Plan or IRA. Unlike
  many other investment vehicles offered to Plans and IRAs, the Trust's assets
  will not be treated as "plan assets" of the Plans or IRAs which acquire or
  purchase Nasdaq-100 Shares. Although ERISA imposes certain duties on Plan
  fiduciaries and ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain
  transactions involving "plan assets" between Plans or IRAs and their
  fiduciaries or certain related persons, those rules will not apply to
  transactions involving the Trust's assets because Nasdaq-100 Shares
  represent an interest in the Trust, and the Trust is registered as an
  investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
  "1940 Act"). ERISA, the Code, and U.S. Department of Labor regulations
  contain unconditional language exempting the assets of registered investment
  companies from treatment as "plan assets" in applying the fiduciary and
  prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code.

  RESTRICTIONS ON PURCHASES BY INVESTMENT COMPANIES

      The acquisition of Nasdaq-100 Shares by registered investment companies
  is subject to the restrictions set forth in section 12(d)(l) of the 1940
  Act.

  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

      The Trust holds the Securities and cash and is not actively "managed" by
  traditional methods, which typically involve effecting changes in the
  Securities on the basis of judgments made relating to economic, financial,
  and market considerations. The composition of the Securities is adjusted,
  however, to conform to changes in the composition of the Index Securities in
  the manner set forth in the Trust Agreement as described herein (see "The
  Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio").

                                      B-11
<Page>
  DISTRIBUTIONS

      Distributions by the Trust are made quarterly to the extent that
  dividends accumulated in respect of the Securities and other income, if any,
  received by the Trust exceed Trust fees and expenses accrued during the
  quarterly Accumulation Period which ends on the Business Day preceding each
  ex-dividend date for Nasdaq-100 Shares. The regular quarterly ex-dividend
  date with respect to net dividends, if any, for Nasdaq-100 Shares is the
  third Friday in each of March, June, September, and December, unless such
  day is not a Business Day, in which case the ex-dividend date is the
  immediately preceding Business Day (the "Ex-Dividend Date"). However, no net
  dividend distribution will be made in any given quarter, and any net
  dividend amounts will be rolled into the next Accumulation Period, if the
  aggregate net dividend distribution would be in an amount less than 5/100 of
  one percent (0.05%) of the net asset value of the Trust, unless the Trustee
  determines that such distribution is required to be made in order to
  maintain the Trust's status as a regulated investment company or to avoid
  the imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income. (See
  "Administration of the Trust--Distributions to Beneficial Owners.")

      At present, and possibly for extended periods of time during the life of
  the Trust, the expenses of the Trust may be as great as or in excess of the
  dividend and other income to be received by the Trust during any quarter
  and, under such circumstances, no quarterly net dividend distributions would
  be made (see "Special Consideration and Risk Factors--Little or No Expected
  Net Dividend Distributions to Beneficial Owners"). Distributions (if any)
  will be made on Dividend Payment Dates to Beneficial Owners via the
  Depository and its participants (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").
  For federal income tax purposes, a portion of any net dividend distributions
  may result in a return of capital to Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares
  (see "Tax Status of the Trust").

      Any net capital gains recognized by the Trust in any taxable year is to
  be distributed at least annually. The Trust may make additional
  distributions after the end of the year in order to satisfy certain
  distribution requirements imposed by the Code (see "Tax Status of the Trust"
  and "Administration of the Trust--Distributions to Beneficial Owners").
  Although income distributions, if any, are currently made on a quarterly
  basis, the Trustee reserves the right

                                      B-12
<Page>
  to vary the frequency of distributions (see "Administration of the
  Trust--Distributions to Beneficial Owners").

  REDEMPTION

      Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations are ordinarily
  redeemable in kind only and are not redeemable for cash except under certain
  circumstances (see "Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares"). Nasdaq-100 Shares can
  be redeemed only in Creation Unit size aggregations effected by a
  Participating Party (with respect to redemptions through the Nasdaq-100
  Clearing Process) or a DTC Participant (with respect to redemptions outside
  the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process), in either case which has executed a
  Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement (see "Redemption of Nasdaq-100
  Shares--Procedure for Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares"). Individual
  Nasdaq-100 Shares are not redeemable, but entitle the owners thereof to
  certain payments upon termination of the Trust (see "Administration of the
  Trust--Termination"). Prior to termination, Nasdaq-100 Share owners may
  aggregate individual Nasdaq-100 Shares to Creation Unit size or multiples
  thereof (E.G., 50,000, 100,000 shares, etc.) and request that the Trustee
  redeem the Nasdaq-100 Shares so aggregated. There can be no assurance,
  however, that there will always be sufficient depth and liquidity in the
  public trading market to complete all such transactions (see "Special
  Considerations and Risk Factors"). Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in less than
  Creation Unit size aggregations may have to pay brokerage fees and
  commissions to acquire sufficient Nasdaq-100 Shares (I.E., 50,000 shares) to
  constitute a Creation Unit. Persons redeeming Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation
  Unit size aggregations may also be entitled to receive, or be required to
  pay, a Cash Redemption Amount (as hereinafter defined, see "Redemption of
  Nasdaq-100 Shares--Procedure for Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares"). On any
  given Business Day, the Cash Redemption Amount will be an amount typically
  identical to the Cash Component of a Portfolio Deposit.

      In the event that the Trustee determines in its discretion that an Index
  Security is likely to be unavailable for delivery or available in
  insufficient quantity for delivery by the Trust upon the redemption of
  Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations, then the Trustee shall
  have the right in its discretion to include the cash equivalent value of
  such Index Security or Index Securities, based on the market value of such
  Index Security or

                                      B-13
<Page>
  Index Securities as of the Evaluation Time on the date such redemption order
  is deemed received by the Trustee (see "Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares"),
  in the calculation of the Cash Redemption Amount in lieu of delivering the
  Index Security or Index Securities to the redeeming investor.

      Similarly, in connection with the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares, if a
  redeeming investor requests redemption in cash, rather than in kind, with
  respect to one or more Index Securities (for example, because a redeeming
  investor is restricted by regulation or otherwise from investing or engaging
  in a transaction in one or more Index Securities), the Trustee shall have
  the right in its discretion to include the cash equivalent value of such
  Index Security or Index Securities, based on the market value of such Index
  Security or Index Securities as of the Evaluation Time on the date such
  redemption order is deemed received by the Trustee, in the calculation of
  the Cash Redemption Amount in lieu of delivering such Index Security or
  Index Securities to the redeeming investor. In all such cases, such investor
  will pay the Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, plus an additional amount
  not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for a Creation
  Unit.

      Furthermore, the Trustee, in its discretion, upon the request of a
  redeeming investor, may redeem Creation Units in whole or in part by
  providing such redeeming investor with a Portfolio Deposit differing in
  composition, but not differing in net asset value, from the then-current
  Portfolio Deposit. Such a redemption is likely to be made only if it were
  determined to be appropriate in order to maintain the Trust portfolio's
  correspondence to the composition and weighting of the Index when a change
  to the composition and/or weighting of the Index Securities occurs (see "The
  Portfolio", "The Index", and "The Index--Rebalancing of the Index").

      The Transaction Fee will be charged in connection with the redemption of
  Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares. If a request for
  redemption is made directly to the Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
  Process, an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction
  Fee applicable for a Creation Unit will be charged to the redeemer due to
  the increased expense associated with delivery outside the Nasdaq-100
  Clearing Process (see "Transaction Fee").

                                      B-14
<Page>
  TERMINATION

      The Trust will terminate by its terms on the first to occur of: (i) the
  date one hundred twenty-five (125) years from the Initial Date of Deposit
  (I.E., March 4, 2124) or (ii) the date twenty (20) years after the death of
  the last survivor of fifteen persons named in the Trust Agreement, the
  oldest of whom was born in 1986 and the youngest of whom was born in 1996
  (the "Mandatory Termination Date"). The Trust may also be terminated earlier
  upon the agreement of the Beneficial Owners of 66 2/3% of the then
  outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Sponsor will also have the discretionary
  right to direct the Trustee to terminate the Trust if at anytime prior to
  March 4, 2002 the net asset value of the Trust falls below $150,000,000 or
  if on or after March 4, 2002 the net asset value of the Trust is less than
  $350,000,000, as such dollar amount shall be adjusted for inflation in
  accordance with the National Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
  (the "CPI-U")(*) as published by the United States Department of Labor, such
  adjustment to take effect December 31, 2003 and at the end of each year
  thereafter and to be made so as to reflect the percentage increase in
  consumer prices as set forth in the CPI-U for the twelve month period ending
  in the month preceding the month in which such adjustment is made. The
  Trustee shall have the right to terminate the Trust in the event that
  (a) the Sponsor resigns or becomes incapable of discharging its duties and a
  successor is not appointed; (b) the Depository is unable or unwilling to
  continue to perform its functions as set forth under the Trust Agreement and
  a suitable replacement is unavailable; (c) NSCC no longer provides clearance
  services with respect to Nasdaq-100 Shares and a suitable replacement is
  unavailable, or if the Trustee is no longer a member of NSCC or any
  successor to NSCC providing clearance services; (d) Nasdaq ceases publishing
  the Index; (e) Nasdaq-100 Shares are delisted from the Amex and are not
  subsequently relisted on a national securities exchange or a quotation
  medium operated by a national securities association (see "Marketplace
  Listing"); or (f) the License Agreement (as hereinafter defined) is
  terminated. The License Agreement currently is scheduled to terminate
  March 10, 2004, subject to a five-year renewal period following such date
  (see "License Agreement"). The Trust shall also terminate if

  the Trustee resigns or becomes incapable of discharging its duties and a
  successor is not appointed (see "Administration of the Trust--
  Termination").

  UNDERWRITING

      ALPS Mutual Funds Services, Inc. (the "Distributor") acts as underwriter
  of Nasdaq-100 Shares on an agency basis. All orders to create Nasdaq-100
  Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations must be placed with the
  Distributor, and it is the responsibility of the Distributor to transmit
  such orders to the Trustee. The Distributor will furnish to those placing
  such orders confirmation that the orders have been accepted, but the
  Distributor will reject any order which is not submitted in proper form.
  Upon acceptance of an order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Distributor
  will instruct the Trustee to initiate the book-entry movement of the
  appropriate number of Nasdaq-100 Shares to the account of the entity placing
  the order. The Distributor is also responsible for delivering a prospectus
  to those persons creating Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Distributor also maintains
  records of both the orders placed with it for the creation of Nasdaq-100
  Shares and the confirmations of acceptance issued by it. In addition, the
  Distributor maintains a record of the instructions given to implement
  delivery of Nasdaq-100 Shares in response to orders placed with it. The
  Distributor may also provide certain other administrative services, such as
  those related to state securities law compliance. The Distributor is a

                    SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS

GENERAL

    Investment in the Trust should be made with an understanding that the value
of the Securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial
condition of the issuers of the Securities, the value of common stocks
generally, and other factors. The composition and weighting of the Index
Securities and hence the composition and weighting of the Securities held in the
Trust also change from time to time (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the
Portfolio", "The Portfolio--Selection and Acquisition of Securities", and "The
Index--Rebalancing of the Index"). There can be no assurance that the issuers of
the Securities will pay dividends on outstanding shares of common stock.
Distributions on the Securities will generally depend upon the declaration of
dividends by the issuers of the Securities; the declaration of such dividends
generally depends upon various factors, including the financial condition of the
issuers and general economic conditions. As discussed above, the Trust, unlike a
managed investment company, will not be actively "managed" by traditional
methods, and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not
result in the elimination of its securities from the Securities held by the
Trust unless the Securities of such issuer are removed from the Index (see "The
Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio").

    An investment in the Trust should also be made with an understanding of the
risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk that
the financial condition of the issuers of the Securities may become impaired or
that the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate (either of which
may cause a decrease in the value of the Securities and thus in the value of
Nasdaq-100 Shares). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market
fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market
confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor
perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors including
expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies,
inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or
regional political, economic, and banking crises. As discussed above, the Trust
will not be actively "managed" and therefore securities held by the Trust will
not be disposed of as a result of or in anticipation of normal fluctuations in
the market.

    Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of
preferred stocks and debt obligations of such issuer because common
stockholders, as owners of such issuer, have generally inferior

                                      B-17
<Page>
rights to receive payments from such issuer in comparison with the rights of
creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such
issuer. Further, unlike debt securities which typically have a stated principal
amount payable at maturity (whose value, however, will be subject to market
fluctuations prior thereto), or preferred stocks which typically have a
liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory
redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a
maturity. Common stock values are subject to market fluctuations as long as the
common stock remains outstanding. The value of the Securities may therefore be
expected to fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust to values higher or
lower than those prevailing on the Initial Date of Deposit (see "Market Risks").

    All of the Securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq National Market.
The existence of a liquid trading market for certain Securities may depend on
whether dealers will make a market in such Securities. There can be no assurance
that a market will be made for any of the Securities, that any market for the
Securities will be maintained, or that any such market will be or remain liquid.
The price at which the Securities may be sold and the value of the Trust will be
adversely affected if trading markets for the Securities are limited or absent.

    An investment in the Trust should also be made with an understanding that
the Trust will not be able to replicate exactly the performance of the Index
because the total return generated by the Securities will be reduced by
transaction costs incurred in adjusting the actual balance of the Securities and
other Trust expenses, whereas such transaction costs and expenses are not
included in the calculation of the Index. It is also possible that for short
periods of time, the Trust may not fully replicate the performance of the Index
due to the temporary unavailability of certain Index Securities in the secondary
market or due to other extraordinary circumstances. Such events are unlikely to
continue for an extended period of time because the Trustee is required to
correct such imbalances by means of adjusting the composition of the Securities
(see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio"). It is also possible that
the composition of the Trust may not exactly replicate the composition of the
Index if the Trust has to adjust its portfolio holdings in order to continue to
qualify as a "regulated investment company" under the Code (see "Tax Status of
the Trust").

    Neither the Depository nor Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares are
entitled either to dispose of any of the Securities in the Trust, as such, or to
vote the Securities. As the beneficial owner of the Securities, the Trustee has
the right to vote all of the voting Securities (see "Administration of the
Trust--Voting").

                                      B-18
<Page>
    Except as otherwise specifically noted, the time frames for delivery of
Securities, cash, or Nasdaq-100 Shares in connection with creation and
redemption activity within the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process as set forth herein
are based on NSCC's current "regular way" settlement period of three (3) days
during which NSCC is open for business (each such day an "NSCC Business Day").
NSCC may, in the future, reduce or increase such "regular way" settlement
period, in which case it is anticipated that there would be a corresponding
reduction or increase in settlement periods applicable to Nasdaq-100 Share
creations and redemptions. Investors should note that NSCC Business Days do not
always coincide with the days during which the Trustee is open for business.

LITTLE OR NO EXPECTED NET DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS TO BENEFICIAL OWNERS

    The Trust Agreement provides for quarterly distributions to Beneficial
Owners via the Depository and its participants (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only
System") on Dividend Payment Dates in the event that dividends accumulated in
respect of the Securities and other income, if any, received by the Trust exceed
Trust fees and expenses accrued during the quarterly Accumulation Period which
ends on the Business Day preceding each Ex-Dividend Date; subject, however, to
such amount falling below a floor for de-minimus distributions, in which event a
net dividend distribution may not be paid and such amount will be rolled into
the next Accumulation Period (see "Administration of the Trust--Distributions to
Beneficial Owners"). Historically, the portfolio of securities comprising the
Index has paid relatively low dividends when compared to the securities
comprising other broad-based stock indices. For example, for the 1997, 1998,
1999 and 2000 calendar years, the ratio of the aggregate dividends paid to total
capitalization for the securities comprising the Index in those periods was
0.13%, 0.07%, 0.03% and 0.06%, respectively. In comparison, the comparable
dividend ratio for the securities comprising the Standard & Poor's 500
Index-Registered Trademark- in those periods was 1.60%, 1.68%, 1.14% and 1.18%,
respectively. (See "The Index" for the historical aggregate dividend yields of
the securities comprising the Index.)


    The Sponsor had undertaken that on each day up to and including
September 30, 2001, the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust would not be
permitted to exceed an amount which is 18/100 of one percent (0.18%) per annum
of the daily net asset value of the Trust (see "Expenses of the Trust").
Notwithstanding such limitation on Trust expenses, the fees and expenses of the
Trust exceeded the dividend and other income on the Securities received by the
Trust during each quarter. No net dividend distributions were made by the Trust
for the year ending


                                      B-19
<Page>

September 30, 2001. No net dividend distributions were made by the Trust for the
period ending September 30, 2001.



    For the period October 1, 2001 to September 30, 2002, the Sponsor has
undertaken to limit ordinary operating expenses of the Trust to 0.20%. After
September 30, 2002 the Sponsor may in its sole discretion, discontinue its
undertaking to limit ordinary operating expenses of the Trust or may renew this
undertaking for an additional period of time, but at a different level which may
be higher than 0.20%. In such event, the likelihood may increase that expenses
of the Trust would exceed the dividend and other income received by the Trust
during each quarter. The Trust will pay any such excess expenses with the
proceeds realized from the sale of Securities effected ordinarily whenever the
Trustee determines that projected annualized fees and expenses accrued on a
daily basis exceed projected annualized dividends and other Trust income accrued
on a daily basis by more than 1/100 of one percent (0.01%) of the net asset
value of the Trust (see "Expenses of the Trust"). Such a sale of Securities will
ordinarily be required to occur no later than the next occurring adjustment to
the Securities held in the Trust to conform to changes in the composition and
weighting of the Index Securities (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the
Portfolio").


    Dividend payment rates of the securities comprising the Index may change
based on numerous factors, including the financial condition of the issuers and
general economic conditions, as well as from changes to the price level of Index
Securities, and from changes to the composition of Index Securities (I.E., the
substitution of one security in the Index with another paying higher or lower
dividends than the security being replaced). (See "The Index" for a discussion
of the selection criteria for determining the Index Securities.) In addition,
the Trust has no operating history by which to measure Trust expenses and
although the amounts of certain ordinary Trust expenses can be estimated, the
growth rate of the Trust, which cannot be anticipated, will directly affect the
level of Trust expenses as a percentage of the Trust's net asset value (I.E., as
the Trust grows in net asset value, certain relatively fixed Trust expenses will
be borne by a greater number of holders of Nasdaq-100 Shares). Accordingly, no
assurances can be given as to the actual level of dividends payable by the
issuers of the Securities or the actual level of Trust expenses, and no
representations are being made as to the level of net dividend distributions, if
any, that may be payable by the Trust.

NET ASSET VALUE AND MARKET PRICES

    The Trust's assets consist primarily of the Securities. Therefore, the net
asset value of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations

                                      B-20
<Page>
and, proportionately, the net asset value per Nasdaq-100 Share changes as
fluctuations occur in the market value of the Securities. Investors should also
be aware that the aggregate public trading market price of 50,000 Nasdaq-100
Shares may be different from the net asset value of a Creation Unit size
aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares (I.E., 50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares may trade at a
premium over or at a discount to the net asset value of a Creation Unit) and
similarly the public trading market price per Nasdaq-100 Share may be different
from the net asset value of a Creation Unit on a per Nasdaq-100 Share basis (see
"--Market Risks"). This price difference may be due, in large part, to the fact
that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for
Nasdaq-100 Shares will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same
forces influencing the prices of the Index component securities trading
individually or in the aggregate at any point in time. The expenses of the Trust
are reflected in the net asset value of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size
aggregations and the expenses of the Trust are accrued daily (see "Expenses of
the Trust").

TRADING CONSIDERATIONS

    The Sponsor does not maintain a secondary market in Nasdaq-100 Shares.
Nasdaq-100 Shares are listed for trading on the Amex. The market symbol for
Nasdaq-100 Shares is "QQQ". Trading in Nasdaq-100 Shares on the Amex may be
halted due to market conditions or, in light of Amex rules and procedures, for
reasons that, in the view of the Amex, make trading in Nasdaq-100 Shares
inadvisable. In addition, trading in Nasdaq-100 Shares on the Amex is subject to
trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Amex
"circuit breaker" rules that require trading in securities on the Amex to be
halted for a specified time period based on a specified market decline. There
can be no assurance that the requirements of the Amex necessary to maintain the
listing of Nasdaq-100 Shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged.
The Trust will be terminated in the event Nasdaq-100 Shares are delisted from
the Amex and are not subsequently relisted on a national securities exchange or
a quotation medium operated by a national securities association. (For a
description of the conditions for the listing of Nasdaq-100 Shares and the
circumstances under which the Amex would consider the suspension of trading in
or the delisting of Nasdaq-100 Shares, see "Marketplace Listing.") Further, the
Trust may be terminated, among other reasons, in the event that the net asset
value of the Trust falls below a specified level (see "Administration of the
Trust--Termination").

                                      B-21
<Page>
MARKET RISKS


    Nasdaq-100 Shares are subject to the risks of an investment in a broad
market portfolio of equity securities, including the risk that the general level
of stock prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such
investment. Nasdaq-100 Shares are also subject to the risk of an investment in a
portfolio of equity securities in economic sectors in which the Index may be
highly concentrated (E.G., technology, see "The Index") as well as to the risks
specific to the performance of a few individual component securities which
currently represent a highly concentrated weighting in the Index (E.G.,
Microsoft Corporation and Intel Corporation, see "The Index"). These include the
risks that the level of stock prices in these sectors or the stock prices of
these specific companies may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of
Nasdaq-100 Shares. In addition, because it is the policy of the Trust to invest
in the securities that comprise the Index, if the Index is concentrated in an
industry or group of industries, the portfolio of Securities also will be
concentrated in that industry or group of industries. Furthermore, investors
should be aware that in the event that one or more stocks which currently have a
highly concentrated weighting in the Index were to leave The Nasdaq Stock
Market, if a company with a large market capitalization were to list its shares
on The Nasdaq Stock Market, or if there were a significant rebalancing of the
Index (see "The Index--Rebalancing of the Index"), then the composition and
weighting of the Index, and hence the composition and weighting of the
Securities in the Trust, would change significantly and the performance of
Nasdaq-100 Shares would reflect the performance of the new Index as reconfigured
(see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio").


    Furthermore, due to the concentration of the Index in sectors characterized
by relatively higher volatility in price performance when compared to other
economic sectors, the performance of the Index may be more volatile when
compared to other broad based stock indices. For example, the annual volatility
of the Index for the 2000 calendar year was 56.69%, while the annual volatility
of the Standard & Poor's 100 Index-Registered Trademark- and the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index-Registered Trademark- for the same period was 23.52% and
22.18%, respectively. For this reason, it is anticipated that the price
volatility of Nasdaq-100 Shares may be greater than the price volatility of
other market-traded securities which are issued by investment companies based
upon indices other than the Index.

    Nasdaq-100 Shares are also subject to risks other than those associated with
an investment in a broad market portfolio of equity securities in that the
selection of the securities included in the Trust's portfolio, the expenses
associated with the Trust, or other factors

                                      B-22
<Page>
distinguishing an ownership interest in a trust from the direct ownership of a
portfolio of securities may affect trading in Nasdaq-100 Shares as compared with
trading in a broad market portfolio of equity securities. Nasdaq-100 Shares are
further subject to the risk that extraordinary events may cause any of the
parties providing services to the Trust, such as the Trustee, the Sponsor, the
Distributor, the Depository, NSCC, or Nasdaq (as the licensor of the Index and
the Index calculator) to be closed or otherwise unable to perform such party's
obligations as set forth herein and in the agreements between and among such
parties. According to the terms of the Trust Agreement, if any of the above
named entities fails or is otherwise unable to perform adequately its duties, a
successor entity may be named or appointed to assume all duties and obligations
of its predecessor. If, however, no suitable successor is available or willing
to undertake all such duties and obligations, under the Trust Agreement the
Trust will then be terminated (see "Administration of the Trust--Termination").

    The Trustee will ordinarily deliver a portfolio of Securities for each
Creation Unit size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares delivered for redemption,
identical in composition to the Securities portion of a Portfolio Deposit as in
effect on the date a request for redemption is deemed received by the Trustee
(see "Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares"). If a redemption is processed through
the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, to the extent that the Securities to be
delivered on settlement date are not delivered, they will be covered by NSCC's
guarantee of the completion of such delivery. Any Securities not received on
settlement date will be marked to the market on a daily basis until delivery is
completed. The Trust, to the extent it has not already done so, remains
obligated to deliver such Securities to NSCC, and the market risk of any
increase in the value of such Securities until delivery is made by the Trust to
NSCC could adversely affect the net asset value of the Trust. Investors should
note that the Securities to be delivered to a redeemer submitting a redemption
request outside of the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process that are not delivered to
such redeemer are not covered by NSCC's guarantee of completion of such
delivery.

    Investors should also note that the size of the Trust in terms of total
assets held may change substantially over time and from time to time as
Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations are created and redeemed.
Such fluctuations in Trust size should not adversely impact the net asset value
per Nasdaq-100 Share at any time because the amount of the Cash Component or the
Cash Redemption Amount upon creations or redemptions, respectively, of
Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations is determined each day to
equate the value of the Portfolio

                                      B-23
<Page>
Deposit to the net asset value of the Trust, on a per Creation Unit basis, at
the close of business on the day such request is deemed received by the Trustee
(see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit").

    Investors in the Trust should also be aware that there are tax consequences
associated with the ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares resulting from the
distribution, if any, of Trust net dividends and sales of Nasdaq-100 Shares, as
well as the sale of underlying Securities held by the Trust in connection with
redemptions or changes in the Index under certain circumstances (see "Tax Status
of the Trust--Tax Consequences to Beneficial Owners").

AFFILIATED RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS


    Investors in the Trust should be aware that the Sponsor of the Trust is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Nasdaq. Nasdaq is the proprietor of the Index as well
as the operator of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the marketplace where the Index
Securities trade. Nasdaq and the Amex, the exchange on which Nasdaq-100 Shares
are listed, operate as separate affiliates of The National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc.


    Under the terms of a license agreement with Nasdaq, the Sponsor has been
granted a license to use the Index as a basis for determining the composition of
the Trust and to use certain service marks and trademarks of Nasdaq in
connection with the Trust (see "License Agreement"). Under the terms of the
license agreement, the Sponsor pays to Nasdaq an annual licensing fee for use of
the Index. The Sponsor ordinarily will seek reimbursement from the Trust for the
amount of licensing fees (see "Expenses of the Trust").

    The Index is determined, composed, and calculated by Nasdaq without regard
to the Sponsor, the Trust, or the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Nasdaq
has complete control and sole discretion in determining, composing, or
calculating the Index or in modifying in any way its method for determining,
composing, or calculating the Index in the future.

                                      B-24
<Page>
                                   THE TRUST

    The Trust is a unit investment trust created under the laws of the State of
New York pursuant to the Trust Agreement.* The Securities held by the Trust
consist of a portfolio of equity securities or, in the case of securities not
yet delivered in connection with purchases made by the Trust or Portfolio
Deposits, confirmations of contracts to purchase such securities (collectively,
the "Portfolio").

CREATION OF CREATION UNITS


    Portfolio Deposits may be deposited with the Trustee via instructions
submitted through the clearing processes of NSCC, following placement with the
Distributor of orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Distributor shall reject
any order that is not submitted in proper form. Investors may deposit Portfolio
Deposits through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process or directly with the Trustee
outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. The Transaction Fee will be charged at
the time of creation of a Creation Unit size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares.
An additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee
applicable for a Creation Unit will be charged to a creator creating outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process (I.E., depositing Portfolio Deposits directly with
the Trustee through DTC), in part due to the increased expense associated with
settlement outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. See "Prospectus
Summary--Transaction Fee" for a detailed description of the amount of the
Transaction Fee and the additional amounts and reductions, limitations, and
waivers applicable thereto, if any. The shares of the Index Securities in a
Portfolio Deposit on September 20, 2001 had an aggregate market value of
$1,452,874.44.


    The Trustee and the Sponsor, from time to time and for such periods as they
may determine, together may increase** or reduce the amount and/or waive the
imposition altogether of the Transaction Fee (and/or the additional amounts
charged in connection with creations and/or redemptions outside the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process) for certain numbers of Creation Units of Nasdaq-100 Shares
created or redeemed,

------------------------

*   Reference is hereby made to the Trust Agreement (a copy of which is
    available to prospective purchasers of Nasdaq-100 Shares at the corporate
    trust office of the Trustee at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286
    during normal business hours), and any statements contained herein are
    qualified in their entirety by the provisions of the Trust Agreement.

**  Such increase is subject to the 10 Basis Point Limit discussed above under
    "Prospectus Summary--Transaction Fee."

                                      B-25
<Page>
whether applied solely to creations and/or redemptions made through the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process (see "Procedures for Creation of Creation Units"),
solely to creations and/or redemptions made outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, or to both methods of creation and/or redemption. The Sponsor also
reserves the right, from time to time, to vary the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares
per Creation Unit (currently 50,000 shares) and such change may or may not be
made in conjunction with a change to the Transaction Fee. The occurrence of any
increase, reduction, or waiver of the Transaction Fee (as well as any additional
amounts, if applicable) and the number of Creation Units created or redeemed to
which such increase, reduction, or waiver applies shall be disclosed in the
current Nasdaq-100 Share Prospectus (see "Prospectus Summary--Transaction Fee").
As of the date hereof, the Sponsor and the Trustee do not contemplate the
increase, reduction, variation by lot-size, or waiver of Transaction Fees in
connection with the creation or redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares or of the
additional amounts charged in connection with the creation or redemption of
Nasdaq-100 Shares outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process beyond that which is
discussed herein under the caption "Prospectus Summary--Transaction Fee."

    The shares of equity securities comprising the securities portion of a
Portfolio Deposit on any date of deposit will reflect the composition and
weighting of the component securities of the Index on such day. The portfolio of
Index Securities that is the basis for a Portfolio Deposit varies as changes are
made in the composition and weighting of the Index Securities (see "The
Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit"). The Trustee will make
available to NSCC prior to the commencement of trading on each Business Day a
list of the names and required number of shares of each of the Index Securities
in the current Portfolio Deposit as well as the amount of the Income Net of
Expense Amount for the previous Business Day. Under certain extraordinary
circumstances which may make it impossible for the Trustee to provide such
information to NSCC on a given Business Day, NSCC shall use the information
regarding the identity and share amounts of the Index Securities of the
Portfolio Deposit on the previous Business Day.

    The Sponsor makes available on each Business Day a list of the names and the
required number of shares for each of the securities in the current Portfolio
Deposit as well as the Income Net of Expense Amount effective through and
including the previous Business Day per outstanding Nasdaq-100 Share. The
Sponsor may choose within its discretion to make available, frequently
throughout each Business Day, a number representing, on a per Nasdaq-100 Share
basis, the sum of the Income Net of Expense Amount effective through and
including the

                                      B-26
<Page>
previous Business Day plus the current value of the securities portion of a
Portfolio Deposit as in effect on such day (which value will occasionally
include a cash-in-lieu amount to compensate for the omission of a particular
Index Security from such Portfolio Deposit, see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to
the Portfolio Deposit"). If the Sponsor elects to make such information
available, it would be calculated based upon the best information available to
the Sponsor and may be calculated by other persons designated to do so by the
Sponsor. If the Sponsor elects to make such information available, the inability
of the Sponsor or its designee to provide such information for any period of
time will not in itself result in a halt in the trading of Nasdaq-100 Shares on
the Amex. If such information is made available, investors interested in
creating Nasdaq-100 Shares or purchasing Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary
market should not rely solely on such information in making investment decisions
but should also consider other market information and relevant economic and
other factors (including, without limitation, information regarding the Index,
the Index Securities, and financial instruments based on the Index).

    Upon receipt of a Portfolio Deposit or Deposits following placement with the
Distributor of an order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Trustee will register
the ownership of the Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations in the
name of the Depository or its nominee. In turn, the Nasdaq-100 Share position
will be removed from the Trustee's account at the Depository and will be
allocated to the account of the DTC Participant acting on behalf of the
depositor creating Creation Unit(s) (see "Procedures for Creation of Creation
Units" and "Book-Entry-Only System"). Each Nasdaq-100 Share represents a
fractional undivided interest in the Trust in an amount equal to one
(1) divided by the total number of Nasdaq-100 Shares outstanding. The Trustee
may reject a request to create Creation Units made by any depositor or group of
depositors if such depositor(s), upon the acceptance by the Trustee of such
request and the issuance to such depositor(s) of Nasdaq-100 Shares, would own
eighty percent (80%) or more of the outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares (see "Tax
Status of the Trust"). The Trustee also may reject any Portfolio Deposit or any
component thereof under certain other circumstances (see "Procedures for
Creation of Creation Units").

    Additional Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations will be
created upon receipt of the appropriate Portfolio Deposits from creators. As
additional Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations are created, the
aggregate value of the Portfolio will be increased and the fractional undivided
interest in the Trust represented

                                      B-27
<Page>
by each Nasdaq-100 Share will be decreased. As discussed above, under certain
circumstances (1) a portion of the securities portion of a Portfolio Deposit may
consist of contracts to purchase certain Index Securities that are expected to
be delivered in a "regular way" manner through NSCC or (2) a portion of the Cash
Component may consist of cash in an amount sufficient to enable the Trustee to
purchase such Index Securities (E.G., in the event that the Trustee determines
that one or more Index Securities are likely to be unavailable or available in
insufficient quantity, or if an entity placing an order to create Nasdaq-100
Shares is restricted by regulation or otherwise from engaging in a transaction
in an Index Security, see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio
Deposit"). In the event there is a failure to deliver the Index Securities which
are the subject of such contracts to purchase or the Cash Component includes
cash in lieu of the delivery of one or more Index Securities, the Trustee will
be instructed pursuant to the Trust Agreement to acquire such Index Securities
in an expeditious manner. To the extent the price of any such Index Security
increases or decreases between the time of creation and the time any such Index
Security is purchased and delivered, Nasdaq-100 Shares will represent fewer or
more shares of such Index Security and more or fewer of the other Index
Securities in the Trust. Hence, price fluctuations during the period from the
time the cash is received by the Trustee to the time the requisite Index
Securities are purchased and delivered will affect the value of all Nasdaq-100
Shares.

    The identity and appropriate number of shares of the Index Securities
required for a Portfolio Deposit are determined in the manner described herein.
Due to changes in the composition and weighting of the Index Securities, the
composition and weighting of the Securities and the prescribed Portfolio Deposit
will also change from time to time (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the
Portfolio" and "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit"). The
composition and weighting of the Index Securities to be delivered as part of a
Portfolio Deposit are determined daily and reflect the composition of the Index
and, together with the Cash Component, have a value equal to the net asset value
of the Trust on a per Creation Unit basis at the close of business on the day of
request for creation. The composition of the Portfolio is also adjusted from
time to time to conform to changes to the Index as described herein and as set
forth in the Trust Agreement. As the composition and weighting of the Index
Securities change, substantially identical changes to the composition and
weighting of the securities portion of the required Portfolio Deposit are made
contemporaneously. Corresponding adjustments to the composition and weighting of
the Portfolio, however, are not necessarily made contemporaneously with
adjustments to the required Portfolio Deposit, but in all cases will be made in
accordance

                                      B-28
<Page>
with the specifications set forth in the Trust Agreement and described herein
(see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio"). Although the composition
and weighting of the securities portion of a Portfolio Deposit change from time
to time, the interests of Beneficial Owners will not be adversely affected
because the composition of such securities and the aggregate value thereof
together with the Cash Component (which may itself have a positive or negative
value, as the case may be), will be calculated based upon the proportionate net
asset value of the Trust (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio").

PROCEDURES FOR CREATION OF CREATION UNITS

    To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor to create Nasdaq-100
Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations, an entity or person must be (1) a
Participating Party, with respect to creations through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process or (2) a DTC Participant with respect to creations/redemptions outside
the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, and in either case must have executed a
Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement with the Distributor and the Trustee. All
Nasdaq-100 Shares, however created, will be entered on the records of the
Depository in the name of Cede & Co. for the account of a DTC Participant (see
"The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").


    All orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares must be placed in multiples of 50,000
Nasdaq-100 Shares (Creation Unit size). All orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares,
whether through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process or outside the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process, must be received by the Distributor by no later than the
closing time of the regular trading session on The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Closing
Time") (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. New York time) in each case on the date such order
is placed in order for creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares to be effected based on the
net asset value of the Trust as determined on such date. The date on which a
creation order (or order to redeem as discussed below) is placed is herein
referred to as the "Transmittal Date." Orders must be transmitted by telephone
or other transmission method acceptable to the Distributor and Trustee, pursuant
to procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement, as described
below (see "Placement of Creation Orders Using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process"
and "Placement of Creation Orders Outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process").
Severe economic or market changes or disruptions, or telephone or other
communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Trustee, the
Distributor, a Participating Party, or a DTC Participant.


                                      B-29
<Page>
    Orders to create Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares shall
be placed with a Participating Party or DTC Participant, as applicable, in the
form required by such Participating Party or DTC Participant. Investors should
be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement, and that, therefore, orders to create Creation Unit size
aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares may have to be placed by the investor's broker
through a Participating Party or a DTC Participant who has executed a Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement. At any given time there may be only a limited number of
broker-dealers that have executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement. Those
placing orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process should afford sufficient time to permit proper submission of the order
to the Distributor prior to the Closing Time on the Transmittal Date.

    Orders for creation that are effected outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process are likely to require transmittal by the DTC Participant earlier on the
Transmittal Date than orders effected using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process.
Those persons placing orders outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process should
ascertain the deadlines applicable to DTC and the Federal Reserve Bank wire
system by contacting the operations department of the broker or depository
institution effectuating such transfer of securities and the Cash Component (if
required). The DTC Participant notified of an order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares
outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process shall be required to effect a transfer
of (1) the requisite Index Securities through DTC by 11:00 a.m. on the next
Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date in such a way as to
replicate the Portfolio Deposit established on the Transmittal Date by the
Trustee in calculating the net asset value of the Trust and (2) the Cash
Component (if required) through the Federal Reserve Bank wire system so as to be
received by the Trustee by 1:00 p.m. on the next Business Day immediately
following the Transmittal Date. If the Trustee does not receive both the Index
Securities by 11:00 a.m. and the Cash Component (if required) by 1:00 p.m. on
the Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date, such order shall be
canceled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be
resubmitted the following Business Day using a Portfolio Deposit as newly
constituted to reflect the current net asset value of the Trust. If the Cash
Component has a negative value, requiring payment of such amount by the Trustee
on behalf of the Trust to the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process (I.E., if the sum of dividends on all Securities
with ex-dividend dates within the Accumulation Period, plus or minus the
Balancing Amount, is less than the accrued expenses and liabilities of the Trust
for such period) then

                                      B-30
<Page>
payment of such amount by the Trustee to the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares via
the Depository and the DTC Participants is required to be made no later than
1:00 p.m. on the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the Transmittal
Date.

    All questions as to the number of shares of each of the Index Securities,
the amount and identity of the payor of the Cash Component (I.E., the Trustee on
behalf of the Trust or the Nasdaq-100 Share creator), and the validity, form,
eligibility (including time of receipt), and acceptance for deposit of any Index
Securities to be delivered shall be determined by the Trustee, whose
determination shall be final and binding. The Trustee reserves the absolute
right to reject a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor in respect
of any Portfolio Deposit or any component thereof if (a) the depositor or group
of depositors, upon obtaining the Nasdaq-100 Shares ordered, would own 80% or
more of the current outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares (see "Tax Status of the
Trust"); (b) the Portfolio Deposit is not in proper form; (c) acceptance of the
Portfolio Deposit would have certain adverse tax consequences (see "Tax Status
of the Trust"); (d) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would, in the
opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit
would otherwise, in the discretion of the Trustee, have an adverse effect on the
Trust or the rights of Beneficial Owners; or (f) in the event that circumstances
outside the control of the Trustee make it for all practical purposes impossible
to process creations of Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Trustee will provide notice of
its reasons for rejection of a creation order in respect of a Portfolio Deposit
or any component thereof. The Trustee and the Sponsor shall not incur any
liability in connection with any notification of defects or irregularities in
the delivery of Portfolio Deposits or any component thereof or in connection
with the rejection of a creation order.


    A list of the Participating Parties or DTC Participants that have executed a
Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement (as hereinafter defined) is available at the
office of the Trustee at 1 Campus Drive, Pleasantville, NY 10570-1602 and the
office of the Distributor at 370 17th Street, Suite 3100, Denver, CO 80202
during normal business hours.


PLACEMENT OF CREATION ORDERS USING THE NASDAQ-100 CLEARING PROCESS

    Portfolio Deposits created through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process must be
delivered through a Participating Party (see "Prospectus Summary--Portfolio
Deposits") that has executed a participant agreement with the Distributor and
with the Trustee (as the same may be from time to time amended in accordance
with its terms, the "Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement"). The Nasdaq-100
Participant

                                      B-31
<Page>
Agreement authorizes the Trustee to transmit to NSCC on behalf of the
Participating Party such trade instructions as are necessary to effect the
Participating Party's creation order. Pursuant to such trade instructions from
the Trustee to NSCC, the Participating Party agrees to transfer the requisite
Index Securities (or contracts to purchase such Index Securities that are
expected to be delivered in a "regular way" manner through NSCC by the third
(3rd) NSCC Business Day) and the Cash Component (if required) to the Trustee,
together with such additional information as may be required by the Trustee. An
order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is
deemed received by the Distributor on the Transmittal Date if (i) such order is
received by the Distributor not later than the Closing Time on such Transmittal
Date and (ii) all other procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant
Agreement are properly followed.

    Nasdaq-100 Shares may also be created in advance of the receipt by the
Trustee of all or a portion of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit
relating to such Nasdaq-100 Shares, but only through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process. In such cases, the Participating Party intending to utilize this
procedure will be required to post collateral with the Trustee outside of NSCC
consisting of cash at least equal to 115% of the closing value, on the day the
order is deemed received, of the portion of the Portfolio Deposit not expected
to be available in the account of the Participating Party for delivery to the
Trust on the third NSCC Business Day following placement of such order, as such
amount is marked-to-the market daily by the Trustee only for increases in such
value. This cash collateral will be required to be posted with the Trustee by
11:00 a.m. on the morning of the NSCC Business Day following the day such order
is deemed received by the Distributor, or else the order to create Nasdaq-100
Shares will be canceled. The Trustee will hold such collateral in an account
separate and apart from the Trust. Under NSCC rules, by midnight of the day
following the receipt by NSCC of such order, NSCC will guarantee to the Trustee
the delivery of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit on the third
NSCC Business Day following receipt of such order or on a later date. Provided
that the NSCC guarantee is established, the Trustee will issue the Nasdaq-100
Shares (in Creation Unit size aggregations) so ordered on such third NSCC
Business Day, relying on the NSCC guarantee to make good on the delivery of the
Portfolio Deposit. In the event that the required securities are not delivered
on such third NSCC Business Day, the Trustee will take steps to "buy-in" the
missing portion of the Portfolio Deposit in accordance with NSCC rules. The 115%
cash collateral received from the creator will be returned net of commissions
and other buy-in expenses incurred by the Trustee, if any, promptly upon
settlement

                                      B-32
<Page>
of delivery of all of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit, or buy-in
of all missing securities, or cancellation of the order to create Nasdaq-100
Shares. Information concerning the procedures for such cash collateralization is
available from the Distributor.

    The requirement to post collateral will not apply in instances where the
Trustee, in its discretion, has included in the Cash Component of a Portfolio
Deposit the cash equivalent value of one or more Index Securities either because
the Trustee determines that one or more Index Securities are likely to be
unavailable or available in insufficient quantity, or if the entity placing an
order to create Nasdaq-100 Shares is restricted by regulation or otherwise from
engaging in a transaction in an Index Security (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments
to the Portfolio Deposit").

PLACEMENT OF CREATION ORDERS OUTSIDE THE NASDAQ-100 CLEARING PROCESS

    Portfolio Deposits created outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process must be
delivered through a DTC Participant that has executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant
Agreement with the Distributor and with the Trustee. A DTC Participant who
wishes to place an order creating Nasdaq-100 Shares to be effected outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process need not be a Participating Party, but such orders
must state that the DTC Participant is not using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process
and that the creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares will instead be effected through a
transfer of securities and cash. The Portfolio Deposit transfer must be ordered
by the DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the
requisite number of Index Securities through DTC to the account of the Trustee
by no later than 11:00 a.m. on the next Business Day immediately following the
Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Index Securities to be
delivered, and the validity, form, and eligibility (including time of receipt)
for the deposit of any tendered securities will be determined by the Trustee,
whose determination shall be final and binding. On days when the Cash Component
is an amount payable to the Trustee (I.E., when the Cash Component has a
positive value), the cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred
directly to the Trustee through the Federal Reserve Bank wire system in a timely
manner so as to be received by the Trustee no later than 1:00 p.m. on the next
Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date. An order to create
Nasdaq-100 Shares outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is deemed received by
the Distributor on the Transmittal Date if (i) such order is received by the
Distributor not later than the Closing Time on such Transmittal Date and
(ii) all other procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement are
properly followed. However, if the Trustee does not receive both the

                                      B-33
<Page>
requisite Index Securities and the Cash Component (if required) in a timely
fashion on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date,
such order will be canceled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such
canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Portfolio
Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the current net asset value of the
Trust. The delivery of Nasdaq-100 Shares so created will occur no later than the
third (3rd) Business Day following the day on which the creation order is deemed
received by the Distributor. The payment of the Cash Component (at times when
such amount is to be paid to the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares from the Trustee)
is required to be made through the Federal Reserve Bank wire system no later
than the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date.
Under the current schedule, the total fee charged in connection with the
creation of one Creation Unit outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process would be
an amount not to exceed $4,000 (see "Prospectus Summary--Transaction Fee").

BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY SYSTEM

    The Depository acts as securities depository for Nasdaq-100 Shares. Cede &
Co., as nominee for the Depository, is registered as the record owner of all
Nasdaq-100 Shares on the books of the Trustee. Certificates will not be issued
for Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    The Depository has advised the Sponsor and the Trustee as follows: The
Depository is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the
State of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing
corporation" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a
"clearing agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Depository was created to hold
securities of its participants (the "DTC Participants") and to facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions among the DTC Participants
in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the DTC
Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations, some of
whom (and/or their representatives) own DTCC,

                                      B-34
<Page>
the parent company of the Depository and NSCC.* Access to the Depository system
is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers, and trust companies
that maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly
or indirectly (the "Indirect Participants"). The Depository agrees with and
represents to its participants that it will administer its book-entry system in
accordance with its rules and by-laws and requirements of law.

    Upon the settlement date of any creation, transfer, or redemption of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Depository will credit or debit, on its book-entry
registration and transfer system, the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares so created,
transferred, or redeemed to the accounts of the appropriate DTC Participants.
The accounts to be credited and charged shall be designated by the Trustee to
NSCC, in the case of a creation or redemption through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, or by the Trustee and the DTC Participant, in the case of a creation or
redemption transacted outside of the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process (see "The
Trust--Procedures for Creation of Creation Units" and "Redemption of Nasdaq-100
Shares"). Beneficial ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares is limited to DTC
Participants, Indirect Participants, and persons holding interests through DTC
Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in
Nasdaq-100 Shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as
"Beneficial Owners") will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership will be
effected only through, records maintained by the Depository (with respect to DTC
Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect
Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial
Owners are expected to receive from or through the DTC Participant a written
confirmation relating to their purchase of Nasdaq-100 Shares. The laws of some
jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability
of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    So long as Cede & Co., as nominee of the Depository, is the registered owner
of Nasdaq-100 Shares, references herein to the

------------------------


*   As of June 30, 2001, the NASD beneficially owned (including shares owned
    directly by the Amex) approximately 8.8% of the issued and outstanding
    shares of common stock of DTCC, and the NASD owned 10,000 shares of
    preferred stock of DTCC, which entitles the NASD to elect one director of
    DTCC. Also as of such date, the Trustee and its affiliates together owned
    approximately 5.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock
    of DTCC.


                                      B-35
<Page>
registered or record owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares shall mean Cede & Co. and shall
not mean the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Beneficial Owners of
Nasdaq-100 Shares will not be entitled to have Nasdaq-100 Shares registered in
their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of
certificates in definitive form, and will not be considered the record or
registered holder thereof under the Trust Agreement. Accordingly, each
Beneficial Owner must rely on the procedures of the Depository, the DTC
Participant, and any Indirect Participant through which such Beneficial Owner
holds its interests, to exercise any rights of a holder of Nasdaq-100 Shares
under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee and the Sponsor understand that under
existing industry practice, in the event the Trustee requests any action of
Nasdaq-100 Share holders, or a Beneficial Owner desires to take any action that
the Depository, as the record owner of all outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares, is
entitled to take, the Depository would authorize the DTC Participants to take
such action and that the DTC Participants would authorize the Indirect
Participants and Beneficial Owners acting through such DTC Participants to take
such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of Beneficial Owners
owning through them.

    As described above, the Trustee recognizes the Depository or its nominee as
the owner of all Nasdaq-100 Shares for all purposes except as expressly set
forth in the Trust Agreement. Conveyance of all notices, statements, and other
communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the
agreement between the Trustee and the Depository (as the same may be from time
to time amended in accordance with its terms, the "Depository Agreement"), the
Depository is required to make available to the Trustee upon request and for a
fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the Nasdaq-100 Share holdings of
each DTC Participant. The Trustee shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as
to the number of Beneficial Owners holding Nasdaq-100 Shares, directly or
indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trustee shall provide each such
DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement, or other communication,
in such form, number, and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably
request, in order that such notice, statement, or communication may be
transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial
Owners. In addition, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall pay to each such
DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses
attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements.

    Nasdaq-100 Share distributions shall be made to the Depository or its
nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered owner of all Nasdaq-100

                                      B-36
<Page>
Shares. The Trustee and the Sponsor expect that the Depository or its nominee,
upon receipt of any payment of distributions in respect of Nasdaq-100 Shares,
shall credit immediately DTC Participants' accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in Nasdaq-100 Shares as
shown on the records of the Depository or its nominee. The Trustee and the
Sponsor also expect that payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants
and Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the
case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or
registered in a "street name," and will be the responsibility of such DTC
Participants. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor has or will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices
to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interests in Nasdaq-100 Shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect
of the relationship between the Depository and the DTC Participants or the
relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and
Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants.

    The Depository may determine to discontinue providing its service with
respect to Nasdaq-100 Shares at any time by giving notice to the Trustee and the
Sponsor and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under
applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trustee and the Sponsor shall take
action either to find a replacement for the Depository to perform its functions
at a comparable cost or, if such a replacement is unavailable, to terminate the
Trust (see "Administration of the Trust--Termination").

                                 THE PORTFOLIO

    Because the objective of the Trust is to provide investment results that
correspond substantially to the price and yield performance of the Index, the
Portfolio will at any time consist of as many of the Index Securities as is
practicable and under most circumstances, all of the Index Securities. It is
anticipated that cash or cash items normally would not be a substantial part of
the Trust's net assets. Although the Trust may at any time fail to own certain
of the Index Securities, the Trust will be substantially invested in Index
Securities and the Sponsor believes that such investment should result in a
close correspondence between the investment performance of the Index and that
derived from ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares.

                                      B-37
<Page>
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PORTFOLIO


    The Index is a modified capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest
non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq National Market tier of The Nasdaq
Stock Market (see "The Index"). At any moment in time, the value of the Index
equals the aggregate value of the then-current Index share weights of each of
the component 100 Index Securities multiplied by each such security's respective
last sale price on The Nasdaq Stock Market, and divided by a scaling factor (the
"divisor") which becomes the basis for the reported Index value. The divisor
serves the purpose of scaling such aggregate value (otherwise in the trillions)
to a lower order of magnitude which is more desirable for Index reporting
purposes.*


    Periodically (typically, several times per quarter), Nasdaq may determine
that total shares outstanding have changed in one or more Index Securities due
to secondary offerings, repurchases, conversions, or other corporate actions.
Under such circumstances, in accordance with Nasdaq policies and procedures for
making adjustments to the Index, the Index share weights would be adjusted by
the same percentage amounts by which the total shares outstanding have changed
in such Index Securities. Additionally, Nasdaq may periodically (ordinarily,
several times per quarter) replace one or more component securities in the Index
due to mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, or other market conditions, or due
to delistings if an issuer chooses to list its securities on another
marketplace, or if the issuers of such component securities fail to meet the
criteria for continued inclusion in the Index (see "The Index"). For example,
for the 1998, 1999 and 2000 calendar years, there were 6, 15 and 5 company
changes, respectively, made during those years due to corporate actions (E.G.,
mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies) and 9, 15 and 12 other company changes,
respectively, made at year-end in connection with Nasdaq's annual evaluation
process for determining the securities comprising the Index for the upcoming
year (see "The Index--Index Security Eligibility Criteria and Annual Ranking
Review"). The ratio of the market capitalization of the securities replaced in
the Index in 1998, 1999 and 2000 to the total market capitalization of the
securities comprising the Index at year-end was 3.1%, 7.2% and 5.1%,
respectively.

    The Index share weights, which are based upon the total shares outstanding
in each of the 100 Index Securities, are additionally subject,

------------------------


*   For example, on September 20, 2001 the aggregate value of the then-current
    Index share weights of each of the Index Securities multiplied by their
    respective last sale price on The Nasdaq Stock Market was $1,477,637,362.41,
    the divisor was 158,371,881 on September 20, 2001, and the reported Index
    value was 1,166.27 on September 20, 2001.


                                      B-38
<Page>
in certain cases, to a rebalancing (see "The Index--Rebalancing of the Index").
Ordinarily, whenever there is a change in Index share weights or a change in a
component security included in the Index, Nasdaq adjusts the divisor to assure
that there is no discontinuity in the value of the Index which might otherwise
be caused by any such change.

    Because the investment objective of the Trust is to provide investment
results that generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the
Index, composition and weighting changes, and associated divisor changes to the
Index, create the need for the Trustee to make corresponding adjustments to the
Securities held in the Trust as described below.

    The Trustee adjusts the composition of the Portfolio from time to time to
conform to changes in the composition and/or weighting of the Index Securities.
The Trustee aggregates certain of these adjustments and makes conforming changes
to the Trust's Portfolio at least monthly; however, adjustments are made more
frequently in the case of changes to the Index that are significant.
Specifically, the Trustee is required to adjust the composition of the Portfolio
at any time that there is a change in the identity of any Index Security (I.E.,
a substitution of one security in replacement of another), which adjustment is
to be made within three (3) Business Days before or after the day on which the
change in the identity of such Index Security is scheduled to take effect at the
close of the market. Although the investment objective of the Trust is to
provide investment results which resemble the performance of the Index, it is
not always efficient to replicate identically the share composition of the Index
if the transaction costs incurred by the Trust in so adjusting the Portfolio
would exceed the expected misweighting that would ensue by failing to replicate
identically minor and insignificant share changes to the Index. Accordingly, to
further the investment objective of the Trust, minor misweightings are generally
permitted within the guidelines set forth below. The Trustee is required to
adjust the composition of the Portfolio at any time that the weighting of any
Security varies in excess of one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of a specified
percentage (a "Misweighting Amount"), from the weighting of such Security in the
Index (a "Misweighting"). The Misweighting Amounts vary depending on the net
asset value of the Trust and are set forth in the table below:

<Table>
<Caption>
NET ASSET VALUE                         MISWEIGHTING

    The Trustee shall examine each Security in the Portfolio on each Business
Day, comparing the weighting of each such Security in the Portfolio to the
weighting of the corresponding Index Security in the Index, based on prices at
the close of the market on the preceding Business Day (a "Weighting Analysis").
In the event that there is a Misweighting in any Security in excess of one
hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the applicable Misweighting Amount, the
Trustee shall calculate an adjustment to the Portfolio in order to bring the
Misweighting of such Security within the Misweighting Amount, based on prices at
the close of the market on the day on which such Misweighting occurs. Also, on a
monthly basis, the Trustee shall perform a Weighting Analysis for each Security
in the Portfolio, and in any case in which there exists a Misweighting exceeding
one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable Misweighting Amount, the Trustee
shall calculate an adjustment to the Portfolio in order to bring the
Misweighting of such Security within the applicable Misweighting Amount, based
on prices at the close of the market on the day on which such Misweighting
occurs. In the case of any adjustment to the Portfolio due to a Misweighting as
described herein, the purchase or sale of securities necessitated by such
adjustment shall be made within three (3) Business Days of the day on which such
Misweighting is determined. In addition to the foregoing adjustments, the
Trustee reserves the right to make additional adjustments periodically to
Securities that may be misweighted by an amount within the applicable
Misweighting Amount in order to reduce the overall Misweighting of the
Portfolio.

    The foregoing guidelines with respect to Misweightings shall also apply to
any Index Security that (1) is likely to be unavailable for delivery or
available in insufficient quantity for delivery or (2) cannot be delivered to
the Trustee due to restrictions prohibiting a creator from engaging in a
transaction involving such Index Security. Upon receipt of an order for a
Creation Unit that will involve such an Index Security, the Trustee shall
determine whether the substitution of cash for such Index Security will cause a
Misweighting in the Trust's Portfolio with respect to such Index Security. If a
Misweighting results, the Trustee shall purchase the required number of shares
of such Index Security on the opening of the market on the following Business
Day. If a Misweighting does not result and the Trustee would not hold cash in
excess of the permitted amounts described below, the Trustee may hold such cash
or, if such an excess would result, make the required adjustments to the
Portfolio in accordance with the procedures described herein.

    Pursuant to these guidelines the Trustee shall calculate the required
adjustments and shall purchase and sell the appropriate securities. As a result
of the purchase and sale of securities in accordance with these requirements, or
the creation of Creation Units, the Trust may hold some

                                      B-40
<Page>
amount of residual cash (other than cash held temporarily due to timing
differences between the sale and purchase of securities or cash delivered in
lieu of Index Securities or undistributed income or undistributed capital gains)
as a result of such transactions, which amount shall not exceed for more than
five (5) consecutive Business Days 5/10th of 1 percent of the aggregate value of
the Securities. In the event that the Trustee has made all required adjustments
and is left with cash in excess of 5/10th of 1 percent of the aggregate value of
the Securities, the Trustee shall use such cash to purchase additional Index
Securities that are under-weighted in the Portfolio as compared to their
relative weighting in the Index, although the Misweighting of such Index
Securities may not be in excess of the applicable Misweighting Amount.

    In addition to adjustments to the Portfolio from time to time to conform to
changes in the composition or weighting of the Index Securities, the Trustee is
also ordinarily required to sell Securities to obtain sufficient cash proceeds
for the payment of Trust fees and expenses at any time that projected annualized
fees and expenses accrued on a daily basis exceed projected annualized dividends
and other Trust income accrued on a daily basis by more than 1/100 of one
percent (0.01%) of the net asset value of the Trust (see "Expenses of the
Trust"). Whenever the 0.01% threshold is exceeded, the Trustee will sell
sufficient Securities to cover such excess no later than the next occasion it is
required to make adjustments to the Portfolio due to a Misweighting, unless the
Trustee determines, in its discretion, that such a sale is unnecessary because
the cash to be generated is not needed by the Trust at that time for the payment
of expenses then due or because the Trustee otherwise determines that such a
sale is not warranted or advisable. At the time of the sale, the Trustee shall
first sell Securities that are over-weighted in the Portfolio as compared to
their relative weighting in the Index.

    All adjustments to the Portfolio held by the Trustee shall be made by the
Trustee pursuant to the foregoing specifications and as set forth in the Trust
Agreement and shall be non-discretionary. All portfolio adjustments will be made
as described herein unless such adjustments would cause the Trust to lose its
status as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code. Additionally, the Trustee is required to adjust the composition of
the Portfolio at any time if it is necessary to ensure the continued
qualification of the Trust as a regulated investment company (see "Tax Status of
the Trust"). The adjustments provided herein are intended to conform the
composition and weighting of the Portfolio, to the extent practicable, to the
composition and weighting of the Index Securities. Such adjustments are based
upon the Index as it is currently determined by Nasdaq. To the extent that the
method of determining the Index is

                                      B-41
<Page>
changed by Nasdaq in a manner that would affect the adjustments provided for
herein, the Trustee and the Sponsor shall have the right to amend the Trust
Agreement, without the consent of the Depository or Beneficial Owners, to
conform the adjustments provided herein and in the Trust Agreement to such
changes so that the objective of tracking the Index is maintained.

    In making the adjustments described herein, the Trustee shall rely on
information made publicly available by Nasdaq as to the composition and
weighting of the Index Securities. If the Trustee becomes incapable of obtaining
or processing such information or NSCC is unable to receive such information
from the Trustee on any Business Day, then the Trustee shall use the composition
and weighting of the Index Securities for the most recently effective Portfolio
Deposit for the purposes of all adjustments and determinations described herein
(including, without limitation, determination of the securities portion of the
Portfolio Deposit) until the earlier of (a) such time as current information
with respect to the Index Securities is available or (b) three (3) consecutive
Business Days have elapsed. If such current information is not available and
three (3) consecutive Business Days have elapsed, the composition and weighting
of the Securities (as opposed to the Index Securities) shall be used for the
purposes of all adjustments and determinations herein (including, without
limitation, determination of the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit)
until current information with respect to the Index Securities is available.

    At such time as the Trustee gives written notice of the termination of the
Trust (see "Administration of the Trust--Termination"), from and after the date
of such notice the Trustee shall use the composition and weighting of the
Securities held in the Trust as of such notice date (as opposed to the
composition and weighting of the Index Securities) for the purpose and
determination of all redemptions or other required uses of the securities
portion of the Portfolio Deposit.

    From time to time Nasdaq may make adjustments to the composition of the
Index as a result of a merger or acquisition involving one or more of the Index
Securities. In such cases, the Trust, as shareholder of securities of an issuer
that is the object of such merger or acquisition activity, may receive various
offers from would-be acquirors of the issuer. The Trustee is not permitted to
accept any such offers until such time as it has been determined that the
securities of the issuer will be removed from the Index. In selling the
securities of such issuer after it has been determined that the security will be
removed from the Index, the Trust may receive, to the extent that market prices
do not provide a more attractive alternative, whatever consideration is being
offered to the shareholders of such issuer that have not tendered their shares
prior to such time. Any cash received in such transactions will be reinvested in

                                      B-42
<Page>
Index Securities in accordance with the criteria set forth above. Any securities
received as a part of the consideration that are not Index Securities will be
sold as soon as practicable and the cash proceeds of such sale will be
reinvested in accordance with the criteria set forth above.

    Purchases and sales of Securities resulting from the adjustments described
above will be made in the share amounts dictated by the foregoing
specifications, whether round lot or odd lot. Certain Index Securities, however,
may at times not be available in the quantities that the foregoing calculations
require. For this and other reasons, precise duplication of the proportionate
relationship between the Portfolio and the Index Securities may not ever be
attained but nevertheless will continue to be the objective of the Trust in
connection with all acquisitions and dispositions of Securities.

    The Trust is a unit investment trust registered under the 1940 Act and is
not a managed fund. Traditional methods of investment management for a managed
fund typically involve frequent changes to a portfolio of securities on the
basis of economic, financial, and market analyses. The Portfolio held by the
Trust, however, is not managed. Instead, the only purchases and sales that are
made with respect to the Portfolio will be those necessary to create, to the
extent feasible, a portfolio that is designed to replicate the Index to the
extent practicable, taking into consideration the adjustments referred to above.
Since no attempt is made to "manage" the Trust in the traditional sense, the
adverse financial condition of an issuer will not be the basis for the sale of
its securities from the Portfolio unless the issuer is removed from the Index.

    The Trust will be liquidated on the fixed Mandatory Termination Date unless
terminated earlier under certain circumstances (see "Administration of the
Trust--Termination"). In addition, Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
Creation Unit size aggregations have the right to redeem in kind (see
"Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares").

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PORTFOLIO DEPOSIT

    On each Business Day (each such day, an "Adjustment Day"), the number of
shares and/or identity of each of the Index Securities in a Portfolio Deposit is
adjusted in accordance with the following procedure. Generally, as of the 4:00
p.m. market close on each Adjustment Day, the Trustee calculates the net asset
value of the Trust (see "Valuation"). The net asset value is divided by the
number of all outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares multiplied by 50,000 shares in one
Creation Unit aggregation resulting in a net asset value per Creation Unit (the
"NAV Amount"). The Trustee then calculates the number of shares (without
rounding) of

                                      B-43
<Page>
each of the component securities of the Index in a Portfolio Deposit for the
following Business Day ("Request Day"), such that (1) the market value at the
close of the market on Adjustment Day of the securities to be included in the
Portfolio Deposit on Request Day, together with the Income Net of Expense Amount
effective for requests to create or redeem on Adjustment Day, equals the NAV
Amount and (2) the identity and weighting of each of the securities in a
Portfolio Deposit mirrors proportionately the identity and weighting of the
securities in the Index, each as in effect on Request Day. For each security,
the number resulting from such calculation is rounded to the nearest whole
share, with a fraction of 0.50 being rounded up. The identities and number of
shares of the securities so calculated constitute the securities portion of the
Portfolio Deposit effective on Request Day and thereafter until the next
subsequent Adjustment Day, as well as the Securities ordinarily to be delivered
by the Trustee in the event of a request for redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
Creation Unit size aggregations on Request Day and thereafter until the
following Adjustment Day (see "Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares"). In addition to
the foregoing adjustments, in the event that there shall occur a stock split,
stock dividend, or reverse split with respect to any Index Security, the
Portfolio Deposit shall be adjusted to take account of such stock split, stock
dividend, or reverse split by applying the stock split, stock dividend, or
reverse stock split multiple (E.G., in the event of a two-for-one stock split of
an Index Security, by doubling the number of shares of such Index Security in
the prescribed Portfolio Deposit), in each case rounded to the nearest whole
share, with a fraction of 0.50 being rounded up.

    On Request Day and on each day that a request for the creation or redemption
of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations is deemed received, the
Trustee calculates the market value of the securities portion of the Portfolio
Deposit as in effect on Request Day as of the close of the market and adds to
that amount the Income Net of Expense Amount effective for requests to create or
redeem on Request Day (such market value and Income Net of Expense Amount are
collectively referred to herein as the "Portfolio Deposit Amount"). The Trustee
then calculates the NAV Amount, based on the close of the market on Request Day.
The difference between the NAV Amount so calculated and the Portfolio Deposit
Amount is the "Balancing Amount." The Balancing Amount serves the function of
compensating for any differences between the value of the Portfolio Deposit
Amount and the NAV Amount at the close of trading on Request Day due to, for
example, (1) differences in the market value of the securities in the Portfolio
Deposit and the market value of the Securities on Request Day and (2) any
variances from the proper composition of the Portfolio Deposit.

                                      B-44
<Page>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, on any Adjustment Day on which (a) no change
in the identity and/or share weighting of any Index Security is scheduled to
take effect that would cause the Index divisor to be adjusted after the close of
the market on such Business Day,* and (b) no stock split, stock dividend, or
reverse stock split with respect to any Index Security has been declared to take
effect on the corresponding Request Day, the Trustee reserves the right to
forego making any adjustment to the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit
and to use the composition and weighting of the Index Securities for the most
recently effective Portfolio Deposit for the Request Day following such
Adjustment Day. In addition, the Trustee further reserves the right to calculate
the adjustment to the number of shares and/or identity of the Index Securities
in a Portfolio Deposit as described above except that such calculation would be
employed two (2) Business Days rather than one (1) Business Day prior to Request
Day.

    As previously discussed, the sum of the Income Net of Expense Amount and the
Balancing Amount in effect at the close of business on Request Day are
collectively referred to as the Cash Component (with respect to creations of
Nasdaq-100 Shares) or the Cash Redemption Amount (with respect to redemptions of
Nasdaq-100 Shares) (see "Prospectus Summary--Portfolio Deposits" and "Prospectus
Summary--Redemption"). If the resulting Cash Component has a positive value,
then the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares will be obligated to pay such cash to the
Trustee in connection with orders to create Nasdaq-100 Shares; if the resulting
Cash Component has a negative value, then such cash shall be paid by the Trustee
on behalf of the Trust to the creator of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Similarly, if the
resulting Cash Redemption Amount has a positive value, then such cash shall be
transferred to a redeemer by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust in connection
with orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares; if the resulting Cash Redemption Amount
has a negative value, then such cash shall be paid by the redeemer of Nasdaq-100
Shares to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust.

    In the event that the Trustee has included the cash equivalent value of one
or more Index Securities in the Portfolio Deposit because the Trustee has
determined that such Index Securities are likely to be unavailable or available
in insufficient quantity for delivery, the Portfolio Deposit so constituted
shall dictate the Index Securities to be delivered in connection with the
creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations and upon the
redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations for all
purposes hereunder until such time as the securities portion of the Portfolio
Deposit is subsequently adjusted. Brokerage commissions incurred by the Trustee
in connection with the

<Page>
acquisition of any such Index Securities will be at the expense of the Trust and
will affect the value of all Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    In connection with the creation or redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares, if an
investor is restricted by regulation or otherwise from investing or engaging in
a transaction in one or more Index Securities, the Trustee, in its discretion,
shall have the right to include the cash equivalent value of such Index
Securities in the Portfolio Deposit in the calculation of the Cash Component (or
the Cash Redemption Amount as the case may be) in lieu of the inclusion of such
Index Securities in the securities portion of the Portfolio Deposit for the
particular affected investor. The amount of such cash equivalent payment shall
be used by the Trustee in accordance with the guidelines regarding allowable
Misweightings and permitted amounts of cash (see "Adjustments to the Portfolio")
which may require the Trustee to purchase the appropriate number of shares of
the Index Security that such investor was unable to purchase. In any such case,
such investor shall pay the Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, plus an
additional amount not to exceed (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for a
Creation Unit.

    The Trustee, in its discretion, upon the request of the redeeming investor,
may redeem Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such redeemer with a
portfolio of Securities differing in exact composition from the Index Securities
but not differing in net asset value from the then-current Portfolio Deposit.
Such a redemption is likely to be made only if it were to be determined that
this composition would be appropriate in order to maintain the Portfolio of the
Trust in correlation to the modified capitalization-weighted composition of the
Index, for instance, in connection with a replacement of one of the Index
Securities (E.G., due to a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy).

SELECTION AND ACQUISITION OF SECURITIES

    In prescribing the method described above for selecting the Index Securities
that constitute the prescribed Portfolio Deposit from time to time, the Sponsor
intends to replicate, to the extent practicable, the composition and weighting
of the Index Securities as of the relevant date.

    Because certain of the Securities from time to time may be sold or their
relative percentages changed under certain circumstances as described herein, no
assurance can be given that the Trust will retain for any length of time its
size and composition (see "Adjustments to the Portfolio"). Also, the deposit of
additional Portfolio Deposits and the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
Creation Unit size aggregations will affect the size and composition of the
Trust. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any
default, failure, or defect in any of the Securities.

                                   THE INDEX


    The Sponsor selected the Nasdaq-100 Index(-Registered Trademark-) as the
basis for the selection of the Securities to be held by the Trust because, in
the opinion of the Sponsor, the Index constitutes a broadly diversified segment
of the largest securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Additionally, the
Index has achieved wide acceptance by both investors and market professionals.
Specifically, the Index is composed of 100 of the largest non-financial
companies listed on the Nasdaq National Market tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market.



    The Index was first published in January 1985, and includes companies across
a variety of major industry groups. The Index does not contain financial
companies, including registered investment companies. As of December 31, 2000,
the major industry groups covered in the Index (listed according to their
respective capitalization in the Index) were as follows: computer and office
equipment (36.21%), computer software/ services (29.65%), telecommunications
(19.13%), biotechnology (9.17%), retail/wholesale trade (2.38%), services
(2.35%), health care (0.62%) and manufacturing (0.5%). The identity and
capitalization weightings of the five largest companies represented in the Index
as of December 31, 2000 were as follows: Cisco Systems, Inc. (6.36%), Microsoft
Corporation (5.15%), QUALCOMM Incorporated (4.80%), Intel Corporation (4.59%),
and Oracle Corporation (4.39%). Current information regarding the market value
of the Index is available from Nasdaq as well as numerous market information
services. The Index is determined, comprised, and calculated by Nasdaq without
regard to the Trust.


    The Sponsor, which is wholly-owned by Nasdaq, has been granted a license to
use the Index as a basis for determining the composition of the Trust and to use
certain service marks and trademarks of Nasdaq in connection with the Trust (see
"License Agreement"). Nasdaq is not responsible for and shall not participate in
the creation or sale of Nasdaq-100 Shares or in the determination of the timing
of, prices at, or quantities and proportions in which purchases or sales of
Index Securities or Securities shall be made.

    The Index share weights of the component securities of the Index at any time
are based upon the total shares outstanding in each of the 100 Index Securities
and are additionally subject, in certain cases, to rebalancing (see "Rebalancing
of the Index"). Accordingly, each Index Security's influence on the value of the
Index is directly proportional to the value of its Index share weight. The
percentage of the Trust's assets invested in each of the Index Securities is
intended to approximate the percentage each Index Security represents in the
Index.

    The following table shows the actual performance of the Index for the years
1985 through 2000. Stock prices fluctuated widely during this period and were
higher at the end than at the beginning. The results shown should not be
considered as a representation of the income yield or capital gain or loss that
may be generated by the Index in the future, nor should the results be
considered as a representation of the performance of the Trust.

INDEX SECURITY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND RANKING REVIEW


    To be eligible for inclusion in the Index, a security must be traded on the
Nasdaq National Market tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market and meet the following
criteria:


    - the security must be of a non-financial company;

    - only one class of security per issuer is allowed;

                                      B-48
<Page>
    - the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy
      proceedings;


    - the security must have average daily trading volume of at least 100,000
      shares;



    - the security must have "seasoned" on The Nasdaq Stock Market or another
      recognized market (generally, a company is considered to be seasoned by
      Nasdaq if it has been listed on a market for at least two years; in the
      case of spin-offs, the operating history of the spin-off will be
      considered);


    - if a security would otherwise qualify to be in the top 25% of the issuers
      included in the Index by market capitalization, then a one year
      "seasoning" criteria would apply;


    - if the security is of a foreign issuer, the company must have a worldwide
      market value of at least $10 billion, a U.S. market value of at least
      $4 billion, and average trading volume on The Nasdaq Stock Market of at
      least 200,000 shares per day; in addition, foreign securities must be
      eligible for listed options trading; and



    - the issuer of the security may not have entered into a definitive
      agreement or other arrangement which would result in the security no
      longer being listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market within the next six months.


    These Index eligibility criteria may be revised from time to time by Nasdaq
without regard to the Trust.


    The Index Securities are evaluated on an annual basis, except under
extraordinary circumstances which may result in an interim evaluation, as
follows (such evaluation is referred to herein as the "Ranking Review").
Securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market which meet the above eligibility
criteria are ranked by market value. Index-eligible securities which are already
in the Index and which are in the top 150 eligible securities (based on market
value) are retained in the Index provided that such security was ranked in the
top 100 eligible securities as of the previous ranking review. Securities not
meeting such criteria are replaced. The replacement securities chosen are those
Index-eligible securities not currently in the Index which have the largest
market capitalization. Generally, the list of annual additions and deletions is
publicly announced via a press release in the early part of December and
replacements are made effective after the close of trading on the third Friday
in December. Moreover, if at any time during the year an Index Security is no
longer traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market, or is otherwise determined by Nasdaq
to become ineligible for continued inclusion in the Index, the security will be
replaced with the largest


                                      B-49
<Page>

market capitalization security not currently in the Index and meeting the Index
eligibility criteria listed above.


    In addition to the Ranking Review, the securities in the Index are monitored
every day by Nasdaq with respect to changes in total shares outstanding arising
from secondary offerings, stock repurchases, conversions, or other corporate
actions. Nasdaq has adopted the following quarterly scheduled weight adjustment
procedures with respect to such changes. If the change in total shares
outstanding arising from such corporate action is greater than or equal to 5.0%,
such change is made to the Index on the evening prior to the effective date of
such corporate action or as soon as practical thereafter. Otherwise, if the
change in total shares outstanding is less than 5%, then all such changes are
accumulated and made effective at one time on a quarterly basis after the close
of trading on the third Friday in each of March, June, September, and December.
In either case, the Index share weights for such Index Securities are adjusted
by the same percentage amount by which the total shares outstanding have changed
in such Index Securities. Ordinarily, whenever there is a change in Index share
weights or a change in a component security included in the Index, Nasdaq
adjusts the divisor to assure that there is no discontinuity in the value of the
Index which might otherwise be caused by any such change.

CALCULATION OF THE INDEX

    The Index is calculated under a "modified capitalization-weighted"
methodology, which is a hybrid between equal weighting and conventional
capitalization weighting. This methodology is expected to: (1) retain in general
the economic attributes of capitalization weighting; (2) promote portfolio
weight diversification (thereby limiting domination of the Index by a few large
stocks); (3) reduce Index performance distortion by preserving the
capitalization ranking of companies; and (4) reduce market impact on the
smallest Index Securities from necessary weight rebalancings.

    Under the methodology employed, on a quarterly basis coinciding with
Nasdaq's quarterly scheduled weight adjustment procedures, the Index Securities
are categorized as either "Large Stocks" or "Small Stocks" depending on whether
their current percentage weights (after taking into account such scheduled
weight adjustments due to stock repurchases, secondary offerings, or other
corporate actions) are greater than, or less than or equal to, the average
percentage weight in the Index (i.e., as a 100-stock index, the average
percentage weight in the Index is 1.0%).

                                      B-50
<Page>
    Such quarterly examination will result in an Index rebalancing if either one
or both of the following two weight distribution requirements are not met:
(1) the current weight of the single largest market capitalization Index
Security must be less than or equal to 24.0% and (2) the "collective weight" of
those Index Securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5%,
when added together, must be less than or equal to 48.0%. In addition, Nasdaq
may conduct a special rebalancing if it is determined necessary to maintain the
integrity of the Index.

    If either one or both of these weight distribution requirements are not met
upon quarterly review or Nasdaq determines that a special rebalancing is
required, a weight rebalancing will be performed. First, relating to weight
distribution requirement (1) above, if the current weight of the single largest
Index Security exceeds 24.0%, then the weights of all Large Stocks will be
scaled down proportionately towards 1.0% by enough for the adjusted weight of
the single largest Index Security to be set to 20.0%. Second, relating to weight
distribution requirement (2) above, for those Index Securities whose individual
current weights or adjusted weights in accordance with the preceding step are in
excess of 4.5%, if their "collective weight" exceeds 48.0%, then the weights of
all Large Stocks will be scaled down proportionately towards 1.0% by just enough
for the "collective weight," so adjusted, to be set to 40.0%.

    The aggregate weight reduction among the Large Stocks resulting from either
or both of the above rescalings will then be redistributed to the Small Stocks
in the following iterative manner. In the first iteration, the weight of the
largest Small Stock will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to
the average Index weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining
Small Stocks will be scaled up by the same factor reduced in relation to each
stock's relative ranking among the Small Stocks such that the smaller the Index
Security in the ranking, the less the scale-up of its weight. This is intended
to reduce the market impact of the weight rebalancing on the smallest component
securities in the Index.

    In the second iteration, the weight of the second largest Small Stock,
already adjusted in the first iteration, will be scaled upwards by a factor
which sets it equal to the average index weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of
the smaller remaining Small Stocks will be scaled up by this same factor reduced
in relation to each stock's relative ranking among the Small Stocks such that,
once again, the smaller the stock in the ranking, the less the scale-up of its
weight.

                                      B-51
<Page>
    Additional iterations will be performed until the accumulated increase in
weight among the Small Stocks exactly equals the aggregate weight reduction
among the Large Stocks from rebalancing in accordance with weight distribution
requirement (1) and/or weight distribution requirement (2).

    Then, to complete the rebalancing procedure, once the final percent weights
of each Index Security are set, the Index share weights will be determined anew
based upon the last sale prices and aggregate capitalization of the Index at the
close of trading on the Thursday in the week immediately preceding the week of
the third Friday in March, June, September, and December. Changes to the Index
share weights will be made effective after the close of trading on the third
Friday in March, June, September, and December and an adjustment to the Index
divisor will be made to ensure continuity of the Index.

    Ordinarily, new rebalanced weights will be determined by applying the above
procedures to the current Index share weights. However, Nasdaq may from time to
time determine rebalanced weights, if necessary, by instead applying the above
procedure to the actual current market capitalization of the Index components.
In such instances, Nasdaq would announce the different basis for rebalancing
prior to its implementation.

                               LICENSE AGREEMENT

    Under the terms of a license agreement with Nasdaq (the "License
Agreement"), the Sponsor has been granted a license to use the Index as a basis
for determining the composition of the Trust and to use certain trade names,
trademarks, and service marks of Nasdaq in connection with the Trust. The
License Agreement may be amended by the parties thereto without the consent of
any of the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Currently, the License
Agreement is scheduled to expire on March 10, 2004 in accordance with its terms
and is subject to a five year renewal period following such date. The parties
thereto may extend the term of the License Agreement beyond such date without
the consent of any of the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    Under the terms of the License Agreement, the Sponsor pays to Nasdaq an
annual licensing fee for use of the Index. The Sponsor ordinarily will seek
reimbursement from the Trust for the amount of licensing fees (see "Expenses of
the Trust").

    None of the Trust, the Trustee, the Distributor, the Depository, or any
Beneficial Owner of Nasdaq-100 Shares is entitled to any rights whatsoever under
the foregoing licensing arrangements or to use the trademarks and service marks
"Nasdaq-100 Index(-Registered Trademark-)",

                              MARKETPLACE LISTING

    Nasdaq-100 Shares are listed on the Amex. Transactions involving Nasdaq-100
Shares in the public trading market are subject to customary brokerage charges
and commissions.

    The Sponsor's aim in designing Nasdaq-100 Shares was to provide investors
with a security whose initial market value would approximate one-fortieth
(1/40th) the value of the Index. Thus, for example, if the Index were at 1600,
investors might expect a Nasdaq-100 Share to trade initially at approximately
$40. Note, however, that the market price of a Nasdaq-100 Share may be affected
by supply and demand, market volatility, sentiment, and other factors (see
"Special Considerations and

                                      B-53
<Page>
Risk Factors"). Note also, that due to these factors as well as other factors
including required distributions for tax purposes (see "Tax Status of the
Trust") or the sale of Securities to meet Trust expenses in excess of the
dividends received on the Securities (see "Expenses of the Trust"), the
one-fortieth (1/40th) relationship between the initial value of a Nasdaq-100
Share and the value of the Index is not expected to persist indefinitely.

    There can be no assurance that Nasdaq-100 Shares will always be listed on
the Amex. The Amex will consider the suspension of trading in or removal from
listing of Nasdaq-100 Shares:

    (a) if the Trust has more than 60 days remaining until termination and there
        are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial holders of Nasdaq-100 Shares
        for 30 or more consecutive trading days;

    (b) if the Index is no longer calculated or available; or

    (c) if such other event shall occur or condition exists which, in the
        opinion of the Amex, makes further dealings on the Amex inadvisable.

    The Trust will be terminated in the event that Nasdaq-100 Shares are
delisted from the Amex and are not subsequently relisted on a national
securities exchange or a quotation medium operated by a national securities
association (see "Administration of the Trust--Termination").

                            TAX STATUS OF THE TRUST

    For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, the Trust qualified for tax
treatment as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Code.
The Trust intends to continue to so qualify. To qualify as a regulated
investment company, the Trust must, among other things, (a) derive in each
taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, gains
from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies,
or certain other sources, (b) meet certain diversification tests, and
(c) distribute in each year at least 90% of its investment company taxable
income. If the Trust qualifies as a regulated investment company, subject to
certain conditions and requirements, the Trust will not be subject to federal
income tax to the extent its income is distributed in a timely manner. Any
undistributed income may be subject to tax, including a four percent (4%) excise
tax imposed by section 4982 of the Code on certain undistributed income of a
regulated investment company that does not distribute to shareholders in a
timely manner at least ninety-eight percent (98%) of its taxable income
(including capital gains).

                                      B-54
<Page>
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO BENEFICIAL OWNERS

    Any net dividends paid by the Trust from its investment company taxable
income (which includes dividends, interest, and the excess of net short-term
capital gains over net long-term capital losses) will be taxable to Beneficial
Owners as ordinary income. A net dividend, if any, paid in January will be
considered for federal income tax purposes to have been paid by the Trust and
received by Beneficial Owners on the preceding December 31 if the net dividend
was declared in the preceding October, November, or December to Beneficial
Owners of record shown on the records of the Depository and the DTC Participants
(see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System") on a date in one of those months.

    Distributions paid by the Trust from the excess of net long-term capital
gains over net short-term capital losses ("net capital gain") are taxable as
long-term capital gain, regardless of the length of time an investor has owned
Nasdaq-100 Shares. Any loss on the sale or exchange of a Nasdaq-100 Share held
for six months or less may be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent
of any capital gain dividends received by the Beneficial Owner. For corporate
investors, net dividends from net investment income (but not return of capital
distributions or capital gain dividends) generally will qualify for the
corporate dividends-received deduction to the extent of qualifying dividend
income received by the Trust, subject to the limitations contained in the Code.
Investors should note that the quarterly net dividends paid by the Trust, if
any, will not be based on the Trust's investment company taxable income and net
capital gain, but rather will be based on the dividends paid with respect to the
Securities net of accrued expenses and liabilities of the Trust. As a result, a
portion of the distributions of the Trust may be treated as a return of capital
or a capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes or the Trust may make
additional distributions in excess of the yield performance of the Securities in
order to distribute all of its investment company taxable income and net capital
gain.

    Distributions in excess of the Trust's current or accumulated earnings and
profits (as specially computed) generally will be treated as a return of capital
for federal income tax purposes and will reduce a Beneficial Owner's tax basis
in Nasdaq-100 Shares. Return of capital distributions may result, for example,
if a portion of the net dividends, if any, declared represents cash amounts
deposited in connection with Portfolio Deposits rather than dividends actually
received by the Trust. Under certain circumstances, a significant portion of any
quarterly net dividends of the Trust could be treated as return of capital
distributions. Such circumstances may be more likely to occur in periods during
which the number of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares fluctuates significantly, as
may occur during the initial years of the Trust. Beneficial Owners will receive

                                      B-55
<Page>
annually notification from the Trustee through the DTC Participants as to the
tax status of the Trust's distributions (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only
System"). A distribution, if any, paid shortly after a purchase or creation of
Nasdaq-100 Shares may be taxable even though in effect it may represent a return
of capital.

    The sale of Nasdaq-100 Shares by a Beneficial Owner is a taxable event, and
may result in a gain or loss, which generally should be a capital gain or loss
for Beneficial Owners that are not dealers in securities.

    Under the Code, an in-kind redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares will not result
in the recognition of taxable gain or loss by the Trust but generally will
constitute a taxable event for the redeeming shareholder. Upon redemption, a
Beneficial Owner generally will recognize gain or loss measured by the
difference on the date of redemption between the aggregate value of the cash and
securities received and its tax basis in the Nasdaq-100 Shares redeemed.
Securities received upon redemption (which will be comprised of the securities
portion of the Portfolio Deposit in effect on the date of redemption) generally
will have an initial tax basis equal to their respective market values on the
date of redemption. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") may assert that
any resulting loss may not be deducted by a Beneficial Owner on the basis that
there has been no material change in such Beneficial Owner's economic position
or that the transaction has no significant economic or business utility apart
from the anticipated tax consequences. Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
Creation Unit size aggregations should consult their own tax advisors as to the
consequences to them of the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    Net dividend distributions, capital gains distributions, and capital gains
from sales or redemptions may also be subject to state, local and foreign taxes.

    Deposit of a Portfolio Deposit with the Trustee in exchange for Nasdaq-100
Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations will not result in the recognition of
taxable gain or loss by the Trust but generally will constitute a taxable event
to the depositor under the Code, and a depositor generally will recognize gain
or loss with respect to each security deposited equal to the difference between
the amount realized in respect of the security and the depositor's tax basis
therein. The amount realized with respect to a security deposited should be
determined by allocating the value on the date of deposit of the Nasdaq-100
Shares received (less any cash paid to the Trust, or plus any cash received from
the Trust, in connection with the deposit) among the securities deposited on the
basis of their respective fair market values at that time. The IRS

                                      B-56
<Page>
may assert that any resulting losses may not be deducted by a depositor on the
basis that there has been no material change in the depositor's economic
position or that the transaction has no significant economic or business utility
or purpose apart from the anticipated tax consequences. Depositors should
consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences to them of a deposit
to the Trust.

    The Trustee has the right to reject the order to create Creation Units
transmitted to it by the Distributor if the depositor or group of depositors,
upon obtaining the Nasdaq-100 Shares ordered, would own eighty percent (80%) or
more of the outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares, and if pursuant to section 351 of the
Code such a circumstance would result in the Trust having a basis in the
securities deposited different from the market value of such securities on the
date of deposit. The Trustee has the right to require information regarding
Nasdaq-100 Share ownership pursuant to the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement and
from the Depository and to rely thereon to the extent necessary to make the
foregoing determination as a condition to the acceptance of a Portfolio Deposit.

    Ordinary income dividends received via the Depository by Beneficial Owners
who are non-resident aliens will be subject to a thirty percent (30%) United
States withholding tax unless a reduced rate of withholding or a withholding
exemption is provided under applicable tax treaties. Non-resident shareholders
are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of
United States withholding tax.


    Backup withholding at a current rate of 30.5% will apply to dividends,
capital gain distributions, redemptions and sales of Nasdaq-100 Shares unless
(a) the Beneficial Owner is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt
categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact, or (b) provides a
taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup
withholding, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a
Beneficial Owner will be allowed as a credit against the holder's U.S. federal
income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund from the IRS,
provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.


    THE TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH ABOVE IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY.
PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF AN INVESTMENT IN
THE TRUST, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF POSSIBLE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES.

                    CONTINUOUS OFFERING OF NASDAQ-100 SHARES

    Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations are offered
continuously to the public by the Trust through the Distributor and are
delivered upon the deposit of a Portfolio Deposit (see "The Trust--Procedures
for Creation of Creation Units"). A list of the identity and number of shares of
each of the Index Securities in the current Portfolio Deposit and the amount of
the Income Net of Expense Amount effective through and including the previous
Business Day is made available by the Trustee to NSCC on each Business Day.
Under certain extraordinary circumstances which may make it impossible for the
Trustee to provide such information to NSCC on a given Business Day, NSCC shall
use the composition and weighting of the Index Securities of the Portfolio
Deposit on the previous Business Day. The minimum number of Nasdaq-100 Shares
that may be created as described herein is 50,000 or one Creation Unit. Persons
making Portfolio Deposits and creating Creation Unit size aggregations of
Nasdaq-100 Shares will receive no fees, commissions, or other form of
compensation or inducement of any kind from the Sponsor or the Distributor, nor
will any such person have any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or
Distributor to effect any sale or resale of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Notwithstanding
the above, the Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
periodically reimburse in whole or in part the Transaction Fees paid by eligible
entities in connection with the creation or redemption of certain lot-sizes of
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    Because new Nasdaq-100 Shares can be created and issued on an ongoing basis,
at any point during the life of the Trust a "distribution", as such term is used
in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), may be
occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities
on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed
participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them statutory
underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability
provisions of the Securities Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm or its
client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after
placing a creation order with the Distributor, breaks them down into the
constituent Nasdaq-100 Shares, and sells the Nasdaq-100 Shares directly to its
customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Nasdaq-100
Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market
demand for Nasdaq-100 Shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter
must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the
activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the
examples mentioned above should not be

                                      B-58
<Page>
considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to
categorization as an underwriter.

    Dealers who are not "underwriters" but are participating in a distribution
(as contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions), and thus dealing
with Nasdaq-100 Shares that are part of an "unsold allotment" within the meaning
of Section 4(3)(C) of the Securities Act, would be unable to take advantage of
the prospectus-delivery exemption provided by Section 4(3) of the Securities
Act. Firms that do incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to
Nasdaq-100 Shares are reminded that under Securities Act Rule 153, a
prospectus-delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act owed
to an Amex member in connection with a sale on the Amex is satisfied by the fact
that Nasdaq-100 Share prospectuses will be available at the Amex upon request.
Of course, the prospectus-delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is only
available with respect to transactions on an exchange.

    The Sponsor intends to market Nasdaq-100 Shares through broker-dealers who
are members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Investors
intending to create or redeem Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100
Shares in transactions not involving a broker-dealer registered in such
investor's state of domicile or residence should consult counsel regarding
applicable broker-dealer or securities regulatory requirements under such state
securities laws prior to such creation or redemption.

                             EXPENSES OF THE TRUST


    The Sponsor had undertaken that on each day up to and including
September 30, 2001, the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust as calculated
by the Trustee would not be permitted to exceed an amount which is 18/100 of one
percent (0.18%) per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust. For the
period October 1, 2001 to September 30, 2002 the Sponsor has undertaken to limit
the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust to 0.20%. To the extent during such
period the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust do exceed such 0.20% level,
the Sponsor will reimburse the Trust or assume invoices on behalf of the Trust
for such excess ordinary operating expenses. The Sponsor retains the ability to
be repaid by the Trust for expenses so reimbursed or assumed to the extent that
subsequently during the fiscal year expenses fall below the 0.20% per annum
level on any given day. For purposes of this undertaking by the Sponsor,
ordinary operating expenses of the Trust shall not include taxes, brokerage
commissions, and such extraordinary non-recurring expenses as may arise,
including without limitation the cost of any litigation to which the Trust or
Trustee may be a party. After


                                      B-59
<Page>

September 30, 2002, the Sponsor may discontinue its undertaking to limit
ordinary operating expenses of the Trust or renew this undertaking for an
additional period of time, or may choose to reimburse or assume certain Trust
expenses in later periods in order to keep Trust expenses at a level lower than
what would reflect ordinary operating expenses of the Trust, but is not
obligated to do so. In any event, it is possible that, on any day and during any
period over the life of the Trust, total fees and expenses of the Trust may
exceed 0.20% per annum.


    Subject to any applicable cap, the Sponsor reserves the right to charge the
Trust a special sponsor fee from time to time in reimbursement for certain
services it may provide to the Trust which would otherwise be provided by the
Trustee in an amount not to exceed the actual cost of providing such services.
The Sponsor or the Trustee from time to time may voluntarily assume some
expenses or reimburse the Trust so that total expenses of the Trust are reduced,
although neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is obligated to do so and either
one or both parties may discontinue such voluntary assumption of expenses or
reimbursement at any time without notice.

    The following charges are or may be accrued and paid by the Trust: (a) the
Trustee's fee as discussed more fully below; (b) fees payable to transfer agents
for the provision of transfer agency services; (c) fees of the Trustee for
extraordinary services performed under the Trust Agreement; (d) various
governmental charges; (e) any taxes, fees, and charges payable by the Trustee
with respect to Nasdaq-100 Shares (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or
otherwise); (f) expenses and costs of any action taken by the Trustee or the
Sponsor to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of Beneficial Owners
of Nasdaq-100 Shares (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or otherwise);
(g) indemnification of the Trustee or the Sponsor for any losses, liabilities or
expenses incurred by them in the administration of the Trust without gross
negligence, bad faith, wilful misconduct, or wilful malfeasance on their part or
reckless disregard of their obligations and duties; (h) expenses incurred in
contacting Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares during the life of the Trust
and upon termination of the Trust; (i) brokerage commissions incurred by the
Trustee when acquiring or selling Index Securities pursuant to the provisions of
the Trust Agreement; and (j) other out-of-pocket expenses of the Trust incurred
pursuant to actions permitted or required under the Trust Agreement.

    In addition to the specific expenses discussed in the previous paragraph,
the following expenses are or may be charged to the Trust: (a) reimbursement to
the Sponsor of amounts paid by it to Nasdaq in respect of annual licensing fees
pursuant to the License Agreement,

                                      B-60
<Page>
(b) federal and state annual registration fees for the issuance of Nasdaq-100
Shares, and (c) expenses of the Sponsor relating to the printing and
distribution of marketing materials describing Nasdaq-100 Shares and the Trust
(including, but not limited to, associated legal, consulting, advertising, and
marketing costs and other out-of-pocket expenses such as printing). Pursuant to
the provisions of an exemptive order, the expenses set forth in this paragraph
may be charged to the Trust by the Trustee in an amount equal to the actual
costs incurred, but in no case shall such charges exceed 20/100 of 1% (0.20%)
per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust.

    If income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other
distributions on the Securities is insufficient to cover Trust fees and expenses
(see "Special Considerations and Risk Factors--Little or No Expected Net
Dividend Distributions to Beneficial Owners"), the Trustee will sell Securities
in an amount sufficient to pay the excess of accrued fees and expenses over the
dividends and other Trust accrued income. Specifically, the Trustee will
ordinarily be required to sell Securities whenever the Trustee determines that
projected annualized fees and expenses accrued on a daily basis exceed projected
annualized dividends and other Trust income accrued on a daily basis by more
than 1/100 of one percent (0.01%) of the net asset value of the Trust. Whenever
the 0.01% threshold is exceeded, the Trustee will sell sufficient Securities to
cover such excess no later than the next occasion it is required to make
adjustments to the Portfolio due to a Misweighting (see "The Portfolio--
Adjustments to the Portfolio"), unless the Trustee determines, in its
discretion, that such a sale is unnecessary because the cash to be generated is
not needed by the Trust at that time for the payment of expenses then due or
because the Trustee otherwise determines that such sale is not warranted or
advisable. At the time of the sale, the Trustee shall first sell Securities that
are over-weighted in the Portfolio as compared to their relative weighting in
the Index.

    The Trustee may also make advances to the Trust to cover expenses. The
Trustee may reimburse itself in the amount of any such advance, plus any amounts
required by the Federal Reserve Board which are related to such advances,
together with interest thereon at a percentage rate equal to the then-current
overnight federal funds rate, by deducting such amounts from (1) dividend
payments or other income of the Trust when such payments or other income is
received, (2) the amounts earned or benefits derived by the Trustee on cash held
by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust, and (3) the sale of Securities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any advance remains outstanding
for more than forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee shall ordinarily sell
Securities to reimburse itself for the amount of such advance and any

                                      B-61
<Page>
accrued interest thereon. Such advances, as well as rights of the Trustee to the
payment of its fee, reimbursement of expenses and other claims, will be secured
by a lien upon and a security interest in the assets of the Trust in favor of
the Trustee. The expenses of the Trust are reflected in the net asset value of
the Trust (see "Valuation").


    The Trustee has agreed to contribute towards the marketing or other
promotion of the Trust and the Nasdaq-100 Shares. This contribution will be
subject to annual review and will be based upon the asset size of the Trust on
the following basis:

    For services performed under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is paid by the
Trust a fee at an annual rate of 4/100 of 1% to 10/100 of 1% of the net asset
value of the Trust, as shown below, such percentage amount to vary depending on
the net asset value of the Trust. Such compensation is computed on each Business
Day on the basis of the net asset value of the Trust on such day, and the amount
thereof is accrued daily and paid monthly. The Trustee, in its discretion, may
waive all or a portion of such fee. Notwithstanding the fee schedule set forth
in the table below, the Trustee shall be paid a minimum annual fee of $180,000
per annum. To the extent that the amount of the Trustee's compensation is less
than such minimum annual fee, the Sponsor has agreed to pay the amount of any
such shortfall.

                        REDEMPTION OF NASDAQ-100 SHARES

    Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations are ordinarily
redeemable in kind only and are not redeemable for cash except under certain
circumstances. Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations may be
redeemed by submitting a request for redemption, the requisite number of
Nasdaq-100 Shares, and the Cash Redemption Amount (as defined below), if
applicable, to the Trustee in the manner specified below. Beneficial Owners of
Nasdaq-100 Shares may sell Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market, but must
accumulate enough Nasdaq-100 Shares to constitute a Creation Unit (I.E., 50,000
shares) in order to redeem through the Trust. Nasdaq-100 Shares can be redeemed
only when Creation Unit size aggregations are owned by a Beneficial Owner and
held in the account of a single Participating Party (with respect to redemptions
through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process) or a single DTC Participant (with
respect to redemptions outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process). Nasdaq-100
Shares will remain outstanding until redeemed or until the termination of the
Trust.

PROCEDURE FOR REDEMPTION OF NASDAQ-100 SHARES

    Requests for redemptions of Creation Units may be made on any Business Day
through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process to the Trustee at its trust office at
101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, or at such other office as may be
designated by the Trustee. Requests for redemptions of Creation Units may also
be made directly to the Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process.
Requests for redemptions shall not be made to the Distributor. In the case of
redemptions made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, the Transaction Fee
will be deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer or added to the
amount owed by the redeemer to the Trustee, as applicable. In case of
redemptions tendered directly to the Trustee outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, a total fee will be charged equal to the Transaction Fee plus an
additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable
for a Creation Unit (due in part to the increased expense associated with
delivery outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process), and such amount will be
deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer or added to the amount owed
by the redeemer to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, as applicable (see
"Prospectus Summary--Transaction Fee"). In all cases, the tender of Nasdaq-100
Shares for redemption and distributions to the redeemer (or payments to the
Trustee, as applicable) in respect of Nasdaq-100 Shares redeemed will be
effected through the Depository and the relevant DTC Participant(s) to the
Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book entry system of

                                      B-63
<Page>
the Depository or the relevant DTC Participant, as the case may be (see "The
Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").


    The Trustee will transfer to the redeeming Beneficial Owner via the
Depository and the relevant DTC Participant(s) a portfolio of Securities for
each Creation Unit size aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares delivered, typically
identical in composition and weighting to the securities portion of a Portfolio
Deposit as in effect (1) on the date a request for redemption is deemed received
by the Trustee as described below, in the case of redemptions made either
through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process or outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process or (2) on the date that notice of the termination of the Trust is given,
in the case of the termination of the Trust (see "Administration of the
Trust--Termination" and "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio"). Each
redemption also includes a cash amount, the "Cash Redemption Amount," which will
either be paid to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust by the redeemer or paid to
the redeemer by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust as described below. On any
given Business Day, the Cash Redemption Amount is typically an amount identical
to the amount of the Cash Component and is equal to a proportional amount of the
following: dividends on all the Securities for the period through the date of
redemption, net of accrued expenses and liabilities for such period not
previously deducted (including, without limitation, (x) taxes or other
governmental charges against the Trust not previously deducted, if any, and
(y) accrued fees of the Trustee and other expenses of the Trust (including legal
and auditing expenses) and other expenses not previously deducted (see "Expenses
of the Trust")), plus or minus the Balancing Amount. To the extent the sum of
dividends on all Securities with ex-dividend dates within the Accumulation
Period, plus or minus the Balancing Amount, exceeds the accrued expenses and
liabilities of the Trust for such period (I.E., the Cash Redemption Amount has a
positive value), then the Trustee on behalf of the Trust will transfer payment
thereof via the relevant DTC Participant(s) to the redeeming Beneficial Owner.
Conversely, to the extent the sum of dividends on all Securities with
ex-dividend dates within the Accumulation Period, plus or minus the Balancing
Amount, is less than the accrued expenses and liabilities of the Trust for such
period (I.E., the Cash Redemption Amount has a negative value), then such
Beneficial Owner shall be required to deliver payment thereof via the relevant
DTC Participant(s) to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. In the case of
redemptions made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, the Trustee on behalf
of the Trust will effect a transfer of the Cash Redemption Amount (if required)
and the securities to the redeeming Beneficial Owner by the third (3rd) NSCC
Business Day following the date on which request for redemption is deemed
received. In the case of


                                      B-64
<Page>

redemptions made outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, the Trustee on behalf
of the Trust will transfer the Cash Redemption Amount (if required) and the
securities to the redeeming Beneficial Owner by the third (3rd) Business Day
following the date on which the request for redemption is deemed received. In
cases in which the Cash Redemption Amount is payable by the redeemer to the
Trustee, the redeeming Beneficial Owner (via the Depository and the relevant DTC
Participants(s)) is required to make payment of such cash amount by the third
(3rd) NSCC Business Day, for redemptions made through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, or the first (1st) Business Day, for redemptions outside the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process, following the date on which the request for redemption is
deemed received. The Trustee will cancel all Nasdaq-100 Shares delivered upon
redemption.


    In the event that the Trustee determines in its discretion that an Index
Security is likely to be unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for
delivery by the Trust upon the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit
size aggregations, the Trustee shall have the right in its discretion to include
the cash equivalent value of such Index Security or Index Securities, based on
the market value of such Index Security or Index Securities as of the Evaluation
Time on the date such redemption is deemed received by the Trustee, in the
calculation of the Cash Redemption Amount in lieu of delivering such Index
Security or Index Securities to the redeemer.

    In connection with the redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares, if a redeeming
investor requests redemption in cash, rather than in kind, with respect to one
or more Securities (for example, because such a redeemer is restricted by
regulation or otherwise from investing or engaging in a transaction in one or
more Index Securities), the Trustee shall have the right in its discretion to
include the cash equivalent value of such Index Security or Index Securities,
based on the market value of such Index Security or Index Securities as of the
Evaluation Time on the date such redemption order is deemed received by the
Trustee, in the calculation of the Cash Redemption Amount in lieu of delivering
such Index Security or Index Securities to the redeemer. In such case, such
investor will pay the Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, plus an additional
amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for a
Creation Unit (see "Prospectus Summary--Transaction Fee").

    The Trustee, in its discretion, upon the request of a redeeming investor,
may redeem Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such redeemer with a
portfolio of Securities differing in exact composition from the Index Securities
but not differing in net asset value from the then-current Portfolio Deposit.
Such a redemption is likely to

                                      B-65
<Page>
be made only if it were to be determined that this composition would be
appropriate in order to maintain the Portfolio's correlation to the composition
and weighting of the Index, for instance, in connection with a replacement of
one of the Index Securities (E.G., due to a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy).
(See "The Portfolio" and "The Index".)

    The Trustee may sell Securities to obtain sufficient cash proceeds to
deliver to the redeeming Beneficial Owner. To the extent cash proceeds are
received by the Trustee in excess of the amount required to be provided to the
redeeming Beneficial Owner, such cash amounts shall be held by the Trustee and
shall be applied in accordance with the guidelines applicable to Misweightings
(see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio").

    If the income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other
distributions on the Securities is insufficient to allow distribution of the
Cash Redemption Amount to a redeemer of Nasdaq-100 Shares, the Trustee may
advance out of its own funds any amounts necessary in respect of redemptions of
Nasdaq-100 Shares; otherwise, the Trustee may sell Securities in an amount
sufficient to effect such redemptions. The Trustee may reimburse itself in the
amount of such advance, plus any amounts required by the Federal Reserve Board
which are related to such advance, together with interest thereon at a
percentage rate equal to the then current overnight federal funds rate, by
deducting such amounts from (1) dividend payments or other income of the Trust
when such payments or other income is received, (2) the amounts earned or
benefits derived by the Trustee on cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of
the Trust, and (3) the sale of Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that any advance remains outstanding for more than forty-five
(45) Business Days, the Trustee shall ordinarily sell Securities to reimburse
itself for such advance and any accrued interest thereon. Such advances will be
secured by a lien upon and a security interest in the assets of the Trust in
favor of the Trustee.

    The Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when so directed by the
Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the date of payment of the
net asset value for more than five (5) Business Days following the date on which
the request for redemption is deemed received by the Trustee (1) for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed; (2) for any period during
which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the
Securities is not reasonably practicable; or (3) for such other period as the
Commission may by order permit for the protection of Beneficial Owners. Neither
the Sponsor nor the Trustee is liable to any person or in any way for any loss
or damages which may result from any such suspension or postponement.

                                      B-66
<Page>
    To be eligible to place orders with the Trustee to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares
in Creation Unit size aggregations, an entity or person must be (1) a
Participating Party, with respect to redemptions through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process, or (2) a DTC Participant, with respect to redemptions outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process, and in either case must have executed a Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement with the Distributor and the Trustee.

    All orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares must be placed in multiples of 50,000
shares (Creation Unit size). Orders must be transmitted to the Trustee by
telephone or other transmission method acceptable to the Trustee so as to be
received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on the Transmittal Date,
pursuant to procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement. Severe
economic or market changes or disruptions, or telephone or other communication
failure, may impede the ability to reach the Trustee, a Participating Party, or
a DTC Participant.

    Orders to redeem Creation Unit size aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares shall
be placed with a Participating Party or DTC Participant, as applicable, in the
form required by such Participating Party or DTC Participant. Investors should
be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement, and that, therefore, orders to redeem Creation Unit size
aggregations of Nasdaq-100 Shares may have to be placed by the investor's broker
through a Participating Party or a DTC Participant who has executed a Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement. At any given time there may be only a limited number of
broker-dealers that have executed a Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement. Those
placing orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares should afford sufficient time to
permit (1) proper submission of the order by a Participating Party or DTC
Participant to the Trustee and (2) the receipt of the Nasdaq-100 Shares to be
redeemed and the Cash Redemption Amount, if any, by the Trustee in a timely
manner, as described below. Orders for redemption that are effected outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process are likely to require transmittal by the DTC
Participant earlier on the Transmittal Date than orders effected using the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process. Those persons placing orders outside the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process should ascertain the deadlines applicable to DTC and the
Federal Reserve Bank wire system by contacting the operations department of the
broker or depository institution effectuating such transfer of Nasdaq-100 Shares
and Cash Redemption Amount. These deadlines will vary by institution. The
Participant notified of an order to redeem outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process will be required to transfer Nasdaq-100 Shares through DTC and the Cash
Redemption Amount, if any, through the Federal Reserve Bank wire

                                      B-67
<Page>
system in a timely manner (see "Placement of Redemption Orders Outside the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process"). Information regarding the Cash Redemption Amount,
number of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares, and Transaction Fees may be obtained
from the Trustee at the toll-free number: (800) 545-5256.

PLACEMENT OF REDEMPTION ORDERS USING THE NASDAQ-100 CLEARING PROCESS

    Orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations
through the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process must be delivered through a
Participating Party (see "Prospectus Summary--Portfolio Deposit") that has
executed the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement with the Distributor and with the
Trustee (as the same may be from time to time amended in accordance with its
terms). An order to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares using the Nasdaq-100 Clearing
Process is deemed received by the Trustee on the Transmittal Date if (i) such
order is received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on such
Transmittal Date and (ii) all other procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement are properly followed; such order will be effected based
on the net asset value of the Trust as determined as of the Evaluation Time on
the Transmittal Date. An order to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares using the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process made in proper form but received by the Trustee after the
Closing Time will be deemed received on the next Business Day immediately
following the Transmittal Date. The Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement authorizes
the Trustee to transmit to NSCC on behalf of the Participating Party such trade
instructions as are necessary to effect the Participating Party's redemption
order. Pursuant to such trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the Trustee
will transfer the requisite Securities (or contracts to purchase such Securities
which are expected to be delivered in a "regular way" manner through NSCC) by
the third (3rd) NSCC Business Day following the date on which such request for
redemption is deemed received, and the Cash Redemption Amount, if any. If the
Cash Redemption Amount is owed by the Beneficial Owner to the Trustee, such
amount must be delivered by the third (3rd) NSCC Business Day following the date
on which the redemption request is deemed received. The calculation of the value
of the Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount will be made according to the
procedures set forth under "Valuation," computed as of the Evaluation Time on
the Business Day on which a redemption order is deemed received by the Trustee.

                                      B-68
<Page>
PLACEMENT OF REDEMPTION ORDERS OUTSIDE THE NASDAQ-100 CLEARING PROCESS


    Orders to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process
must be delivered through a DTC Participant that has executed the Nasdaq-100
Participant Agreement with the Distributor and with the Trustee. A DTC
Participant who wishes to place an order for redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares to
be effected outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process need not be a Participating
Party, but such orders must state that the DTC Participant is not using the
Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process and that redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares will
instead be effected through transfer of Nasdaq-100 Shares directly through DTC.
An order to redeem Nasdaq-100 Shares outside the Nasdaq-100 Clearing Process is
deemed received by the Trustee on the Transmittal Date if (i) such order is
received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on such Transmittal
Date, (ii) such order is preceded or accompanied by the requisite number of
Nasdaq-100 Shares specified in such order, which delivery must be made through
DTC to the Trustee no later than the Closing Time of the regular trading session
on The Nasdaq Stock Market on such Transmittal Date and (iii) all other
procedures set forth in the Nasdaq-100 Participant Agreement are properly
followed. The Cash Redemption Amount owed by the Beneficial Owner, if any, must
be delivered no later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately following
the Transmittal Date.


    After the Trustee has deemed an order for redemption outside the Nasdaq-100
Clearing Process received, the Trustee will initiate procedures to transfer the
requisite Securities (or contracts to purchase such Securities which are
expected to be delivered within three Business Days) and the Cash Redemption
Amount to the redeeming Beneficial Owner (where such amount is payable from the
Trustee to the Beneficial Owner) by the third (3rd) Business Day following the
Transmittal Date on which such redemption order is deemed received by the
Trustee.

    The calculation of the value of the Securities and the Cash Redemption
Amount will be made by the Trustee according to the procedures set forth under
"Valuation," computed as of the Evaluation Time on the Business Day on which a
redemption order is deemed received by the Trustee. Therefore, if a redemption
order in proper form is submitted to the Trustee by a DTC Participant not later
than the Closing Time on the Transmittal Date, and the requisite Nasdaq-100
Shares are also delivered to the Trustee prior to the Closing Time on such
Transmittal Date, then the value of the Securities and the Cash Redemption
Amount will be determined by the Trustee as of the Evaluation Time on such
Transmittal Date. If, however, a redemption

                                      B-69
<Page>
order is submitted to the Trustee by a DTC Participant not later than the
Closing Time on a Transmittal Date but either (1) the requisite Nasdaq-100
Shares are NOT delivered by the Closing Time on such Transmittal Date or
(2) the redemption order is not submitted in proper form, then the redemption
order will NOT be deemed received as of such Transmittal Date. In such case, the
value of the Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount will be computed as of
the Evaluation Time on the Business Day that such order is deemed received by
the Trustee, I.E., the Business Day on which the Nasdaq-100 Shares are delivered
through DTC to the Trustee by the Closing Time on such Business Day pursuant to
a properly submitted redemption order.

                                   VALUATION

    The net asset value of the Trust is computed as of the Evaluation Time shown
under "Essential Information" on each Business Day. The net asset value of the
Trust on a per Nasdaq-100 Share basis is determined by subtracting all
liabilities (including accrued expenses and dividends payable) from the total
value of the Trust's investments and other assets and dividing the result by the
total number of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares.


    The aggregate value of the Securities shall be determined by the Trustee in
good faith in the following manner. The value of a Security shall generally be
based on the closing sale price for the Security on that day (unless the Trustee
deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) on The Nasdaq Stock
Market or, if there is no such appropriate closing sale price on The Nasdaq
Stock Market, at the closing bid price (unless the Trustee deems such price
inappropriate as a basis for evaluation). If a Security is not so quoted on The
Nasdaq Stock Market or, if so quoted and the principal market therefor is other
than on The Nasdaq Stock Market or there is no such closing bid price available,
such evaluation shall generally be made by the Trustee in good faith based
(a) on the closing price for the Security on another market on which the
Security is traded, if available, or otherwise based on the closing sale price
on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the last day that the security traded (unless the
Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) or if there is
no such appropriate closing price, at the closing bid price on such other
market, (b) on current bid prices on The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other
markets, (c) if bid prices are not available, on the basis of current bid prices
for comparable securities, (d) by the Trustee's appraising the value of the
Securities in good faith on the bid side of the market, or (e) by any
combination thereof.

                          ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST

RECORDS

    The Trustee maintains records of the transactions of the Trust, including a
current list of the identity and number of shares of each of the Securities in
the Portfolio. Records of the creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit
size aggregations are also maintained by the Distributor. Record of ownership of
Nasdaq-100 Shares is maintained by the Depository and by DTC Participants as
described above (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").

    A complete copy of the Trust Agreement is maintained by the Trustee. A copy
of the Trust Agreement is available to Beneficial Owners at the corporate trust
office of the Trustee at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286 during
normal business hours.

VOTING

    The Trustee has the right to vote all of the voting securities in the Trust.
The Trustee votes the voting securities of each issuer in the same proportionate
relationship as all other shares of each such issuer are voted to the extent
permissible and, if not permitted, abstains from voting.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO BENEFICIAL OWNERS

    Distributions by the Trust will be made quarterly in the event that
dividends accumulated in respect of the Securities and other income, if any,
received by the Trust, exceed Trust fees and expenses accrued during the
quarterly Accumulation Period which ends on the Business Day preceding each
Ex-Dividend Date. Based on historical dividend payment rates of the portfolio of
securities comprising the Index and estimated ordinary operating expenses of the
Trust, little or no such distributions are currently anticipated (see "Special
Considerations and Risk Factors--Little or No Expected Net Dividend
Distributions to Beneficial Owners").

    The regular quarterly Ex-Dividend Date with respect to net dividends, if
any, for Nasdaq-100 Shares is the third Friday in each of March, June,
September, and December, unless such day is not a Business Day, in which case
the Ex-Dividend Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. Beneficial
Owners as reflected on the records of the Depository and the DTC Participants on
the second Business Day following the Ex-Dividend Date (the "Record Date") are
entitled to receive an amount, if any, representing dividends accumulated

                                      B-71
<Page>
on the Securities through the quarterly Accumulation Period which ends on the
Business Day preceding such Ex-Dividend Date (including Securities with
ex-dividend dates falling within such quarterly dividend period) and other
income, if any, received by the Trust, net of the fees and expenses of the
Trust, accrued daily for such period. For the purposes of such distributions,
dividends per Nasdaq-100 Share are calculated at least to the nearest 1/100th of
$0.01. However, there shall be no net dividend distribution in any given
quarter, and any net dividend amounts will be rolled into the next Accumulation
Period, if the aggregate net dividend distribution would be in an amount less
than 5/100 of one percent (0.05%) of the net asset value of the Trust as of the
Friday in the week immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date, unless the
Trustee determines that such net dividend distribution is required to be made in
order to maintain the Trust's status as a regulated investment company or to
avoid the imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income (see "Tax
Status of the Trust"). When net dividend payments are to be made by the Trust,
payment will be made on the last Business Day in the calendar month following
each Ex-Dividend Date (the "Dividend Payment Date"). Dividend payments will be
made through the Depository and the DTC Participants to Beneficial Owners then
of record with funds received from the Trustee. Nasdaq-100 Shares are registered
in book-entry only, which records are kept by the Depository (see "The
Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").

    Dividends payable to the Trust in respect of the Securities are credited by
the Trustee to a non-interest bearing account as of the date on which the Trust
receives such dividends. Other moneys received by the Trustee in respect of the
Securities, including but not limited to the Cash Component, the Cash Redemption
Amount, all moneys realized by the Trustee from the sale of options, warrants,
or other similar rights received or distributed in respect of the Securities as
dividends or distributions and capital gains resulting from the sale of
Securities, are also credited by the Trustee to a non-interest bearing account.
All funds collected or received are held by the Trustee without interest until
distributed or otherwise utilized in accordance with the provisions of the Trust
Agreement. To the extent the amounts credited to such accounts generate interest
income or an equivalent benefit to the Trustee, such interest income or benefit
is used to reduce any charges made in connection with advances made by the
Trustee on behalf of the Trust to cover Trust expenses in those cases when the
Trust income is insufficient to pay such expenses when due (see "Expenses of the
Trust").

    The Trust has qualified, and intends to continue to qualify, as a regulated
investment company for federal income tax purposes. A

                                      B-72
<Page>
regulated investment company is not subject to federal income tax on its net
investment income and capital gains that it distributes to shareholders, so long
as it meets certain overall distribution and diversification requirements and
other conditions under Subchapter M of the Code. The Trust intends to satisfy
these overall distribution and diversification requirements and to otherwise
satisfy any required conditions. The Trustee intends to make additional
distributions to the minimum extent necessary (i) to distribute the entire
annual investment company taxable income of the Trust, plus any net capital
gains (from sales of securities in connection with adjustments to the Portfolio,
payment of the expenses of the Trust, or to generate cash for such
distributions), and (ii) to avoid imposition of the excise tax imposed by
section 4982 of the Code (see "Tax Status of the Trust"). The additional
distributions, if needed, would consist of (a) any amount by which estimated
Trust investment company taxable income and net capital gains for a fiscal year
exceeds the amount of Trust taxable income previously distributed with respect
to such year or, if greater, the minimum amount required to avoid imposition of
such excise tax, and (b) a distribution soon after the actual annual investment
company taxable income and net capital gains of the Trust have been computed of
the amount, if any, by which such actual income exceeds the distributions
already made. The net asset value of the Trust will be reduced by the amount of
such additional distributions. The magnitude of the additional distributions, if
any, will depend upon a number of factors, including the level of redemption
activity experienced by the Trust. Because substantially all proceeds from the
sale of Securities in connection with adjustments to the Portfolio will have
been used to purchase shares of Index Securities, the Trust may have no cash or
insufficient cash with which to pay any such additional distributions. In that
case, the Trustee typically will have to sell shares of the Securities
sufficient to produce the cash required to make such additional distributions.
In selecting the Securities to be sold to produce cash for such distributions,
the Trustee will choose among the Securities that are over-weighted in the
Portfolio relative to their weighting in the Index first and then from among all
other Securities in a manner so as to maintain the weighting of each of the
Securities within the applicable Misweighting Amount (see "The
Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio").

    The Trustee further reserves the right to declare special dividends if, in
its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve the
status of the Trust as a regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of
income or excise taxes on undistributed income.

                                      B-73
<Page>
    The Trustee further reserves the right to vary the frequency with which
periodic distributions, if any, are to be made from the Trust (E.G., from
quarterly to semi-annually) if it is determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee,
in their discretion, that such a variance would be advisable to facilitate
compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to regulated investment
companies or would otherwise be advantageous to the Trust. In addition, the
Trustee reserves the right to change the regular Ex-Dividend Date for Nasdaq-100
Shares to another regular date if it is determined by the Sponsor and the
Trustee, in their discretion, that such a change would be advantageous to the
Trust. Notice of any such variance or change (which notice shall include changes
to the Record Date, the Ex-Dividend Date, the Dividend Payment Date, and the
Accumulation Period resulting from such variance) shall be provided to
Beneficial Owners via the Depository and the DTC Participants (see "The
Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").

    The Trustee may, in its discretion, advance out of its own funds any amounts
necessary to permit distributions via the Depository to Beneficial Owners. The
Trustee may reimburse itself in the amount of such advance, together with
interest thereon at a percentage rate equal to then current overnight federal
funds rate, plus Federal Reserve Bank requirements, by deducting such amounts
from (1) dividend payments or other income of the Trust when such payments or
other income is received, (2) the amounts earned or benefits derived by the
Trustee on cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust, and (3) the
sale of Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any advance
remains outstanding for more than forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee
shall ordinarily sell Securities to reimburse itself for such advance and any
accrued interest thereon. Such advances will be secured by a lien upon and a
security interest in the assets of the Trust in favor of the Trustee.

    In addition, as soon as practicable after notice of termination of the
Trust, the Trustee will distribute via the Depository and the DTC Participants
to each Beneficial Owner redeeming Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size
aggregations prior to the termination date specified in such notice, a portion
of the Securities and cash as described above (see "Redemption of Nasdaq-100
Shares" and "Administration of the Trust--Termination"). Otherwise, the Trustee
will distribute to each Beneficial Owner (whether in Creation Unit size
aggregations or otherwise), as soon as practical after termination of the Trust,
such Beneficial Owner's pro rata share in cash of the net asset value of the
Trust (see "Administration of the Trust--Termination").

                                      B-74
<Page>
    All distributions are made by the Trustee through the Depository and the DTC
Participants to Beneficial Owners as recorded on the book entry system of the
Depository and the DTC Participants (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").

    The settlement date for the creation of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit
size aggregations or the purchase of Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market
must occur on or prior to the Record Date in order for such creator or purchaser
to receive any distributions made by the Trust on the next Dividend Payment
Date. If the settlement date for such creation or a secondary market purchase
occurs after the Record Date, the distribution will be made to the prior
security holder or Beneficial Owner as of such Record Date.

TRUST SUPERVISION

    The Trust's Portfolio is not managed and therefore the adverse financial
condition of an issuer of securities in the Trust does not, in itself, require
the sale of Securities from the Portfolio. The Trustee shall, on a
non-discretionary basis, make changes to the Portfolio as described above (see
"The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio").


    The Trustee will direct its securities transactions only to brokers or
dealers, which may include affiliates of the Trustee and others from whom it
expects to obtain the most favorable prices for execution of orders, subject to
meeting the investment objectives of the Trust.


STATEMENTS TO BENEFICIAL OWNERS

    With each distribution, the Trustee will furnish for distribution to
Beneficial Owners (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System") a statement setting
forth the amount being distributed expressed as a dollar amount per Nasdaq-100
Share.

    Promptly after the end of each fiscal year, the Trustee will furnish to the
DTC Participants, for distribution to each person who was a Beneficial Owner of
Nasdaq-100 Shares at the end of such fiscal year, an annual report of the Trust
containing financial statements audited by independent accountants of nationally
recognized standing and such other information as may be required by applicable
laws, rules, and regulations.

REGISTER OF OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER

    The Trustee maintains a record of the creation and redemption of Nasdaq-100
Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations. The Depository maintains a record on
its book-entry system of the DTC Participant

                                      B-75
<Page>
ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares and the number of Nasdaq-100 Shares owned (see
"The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System"). Certificates are not issued for Nasdaq-100
Shares, whether in Creation Unit size denominations or otherwise. Beneficial
Owners have the rights accorded to holders of "book-entry" securities under
applicable law. Beneficial Owners may transfer Nasdaq-100 Shares through the
Depository by instructing the DTC Participant(s) holding the Nasdaq-100 Shares
for such Beneficial Owner in accordance with standard securities industry
procedures.

RIGHTS OF BENEFICIAL OWNERS

    Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations (I.E., 50,000
Nasdaq-100 Shares) may be tendered to the Trustee for redemption (see
"Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares"). Beneficial Owners may sell Nasdaq-100 Shares
in the secondary market, but must accumulate enough Nasdaq-100 Shares (I.E.,
50,000 shares) to constitute a full Creation Unit in order to redeem through the
Trust. The death or incapacity of any Beneficial Owner will not operate to
terminate the Trust nor entitle such Beneficial Owner's legal representatives or
heirs to claim an accounting or to take any action or proceeding in any court
for a partition or winding up of the Trust. By its purchase of a Nasdaq-100
Share, each Beneficial Owner expressly waives any right he or she may have under
law to require the Trustee at any time to account, in any manner other than as
expressly provided in the Trust Agreement, for the Securities or moneys from
time to time received, held, and applied by the Trustee under the Trust.

    Beneficial Owners shall not have the right to vote concerning the Trust,
except as described below with respect to termination and as otherwise expressly
set forth in the Trust Agreement or in any manner control the operation and
management of the Trust, nor shall any Beneficial Owner be liable to any other
person by reason of any action taken by the Sponsor or the Trustee.

AMENDMENT

    The Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Trustee and the
Sponsor without the consent of any Beneficial Owners (a) to cure any ambiguity
or to correct or supplement any provision thereof which may be defective or
inconsistent or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions
arising thereunder as will not adversely affect the interests of Beneficial
Owners; (b) to change any provision thereof as may be required by the
Commission; (c) to add or change any provision as may be necessary or advisable
for the continuing

                                      B-76
<Page>
qualification of the Trust as a "regulated investment company" under the Code;
(d) to add or change any provision thereof as may be necessary or advisable in
the event that NSCC or the Depository is unable or unwilling to continue to
perform its functions as set forth therein; (e) to add or change any provision
thereof to conform the adjustments to the Portfolio and the Portfolio Deposit to
changes, if any, made by Nasdaq in its method of determining the Index; (f) to
add or change any provision thereof as may be necessary to implement a dividend
reinvestment plan or service; (g) to make changes to the Transaction Fee and to
other amounts charged in connection with creations and redemptions of Nasdaq-100
Shares within the original parameters set forth in the Trust Agreement; and
(h) to make changes to the level of net dividends below which a dividend
distribution will not be paid in a given quarter and will instead be rolled into
the next Accumulation Period.

    The Trust Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Sponsor and
the Trustee with the consent of the Beneficial Owners of 51% of the outstanding
Nasdaq-100 Shares to add provisions to or change or eliminate any of the
provisions of the Trust Agreement or to modify the rights of Beneficial Owners;
provided, however, that the Trust Agreement may not be amended without the
consent of the Beneficial Owners of all outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares if such
amendment would (1) permit, except in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Trust Agreement, the acquisition of any securities other than those
acquired in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement;
(2) reduce the interest of any Beneficial Owner in the Trust; or (3) reduce the
percentage of Beneficial Owners required to consent to any such amendment.

    Promptly after the execution of any such amendment, the Trustee shall
receive from the Depository, pursuant to the terms of the Depository Agreement,
a list of all DTC Participants holding Nasdaq-100 Shares. The Trustee shall
inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners for
whom such DTC Participant holds Nasdaq-100 Shares, and provide each such DTC
Participant with sufficient copies of a written notice of the substance of such
amendment for transmittal by each such DTC Participant to such Beneficial Owners
(see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System").

TERMINATION

    The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor has the discretionary right to
direct the Trustee to terminate the Trust if at any time prior to March 4, 2002
the net asset value of the Trust falls below $150,000,000 or if at any time on
or after three years following the Initial Date of

                                      B-77
<Page>
Deposit the net asset value of the Trust is less than $350,000,000, as such
dollar amount shall be adjusted for inflation in accordance with the CPI-U, such
adjustment to take effect at the end of the fourth year following the Initial
Date of Deposit and at the end of each year thereafter and to be made so as to
reflect the percentage increase in consumer prices as set forth in the CPI-U for
the twelve month period ending in the last month of the preceding fiscal year.

    The Trust will also terminate in the event that Nasdaq-100 Shares are
delisted from the Amex and are not subsequently relisted on a national
securities exchange or a quotation medium operated by a national securities
association. The Amex will consider the suspension of trading in or the
delisting of Nasdaq-100 Shares as discussed above (see "Marketplace Listing").

    The Trust may also be terminated (a) by the agreement of the Beneficial
Owners of 66 2/3% of outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares; (b) if the Depository is
unable or unwilling to continue to perform its functions as set forth under the
Trust Agreement and a suitable replacement is unavailable; (c) if NSCC no longer
provides clearance services with respect to Nasdaq-100 Shares and a suitable
replacement is unavailable, or if the Trustee is no longer a participant in NSCC
or any successor to NSCC providing clearance services; (d) if Nasdaq ceases
publishing the Index; and (e) if the License Agreement is terminated. Currently,
the License Agreement is scheduled to expire on March 10, 2004 in accordance
with its terms and is subject to a five year renewal period following such date.
The Trust will also terminate by its terms on the Mandatory Termination Date.

    If either the Sponsor or the Trustee shall resign or be removed and a
successor is not appointed, the Trust will terminate (see "Resignation, Removal
and Liability--The Trustee" and "Resignation, Removal and Liability--The
Sponsor"). The dissolution of the Sponsor or its ceasing to exist as a legal
entity for any cause whatsoever, however, will not cause the termination of the
Trust Agreement or the Trust unless the Trustee deems termination to be in the
best interests of Beneficial Owners.

    Prior written notice of the termination of the Trust will be given at least
twenty (20) days prior to termination of the Trust to all Beneficial Owners in
the manner described above (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System"). The notice
will set forth the date on which the Trust will be terminated (the "Termination
Date"), the period during which the assets of the Trust will be liquidated, the
date on which Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares (whether in Creation Unit
size aggregations or otherwise) will receive in cash the net asset value of the

                                      B-78
<Page>
Nasdaq-100 Shares held, and the date determined by the Trustee upon which the
books of the Trust shall be closed. Such notice shall further state that, as of
the date thereof and thereafter, neither requests to create additional Creation
Units nor Portfolio Deposits will be accepted, and that, as of the date thereof
and thereafter, the portfolio of Securities delivered upon redemption shall be
essentially identical in composition and weighting to the Securities held in the
Trust as of such date rather than the securities portion of the Portfolio
Deposit as in effect on the date the request for redemption is deemed received.
Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations may,
in advance of the Termination Date, redeem in kind directly from the Trust (see
"Redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares").

    Within a reasonable period of time after the Termination Date the Trustee
shall, subject to any applicable provisions of law, use its best efforts to sell
all of the Securities not already distributed to redeeming Beneficial Owners of
Creation Units. The Trustee shall not be liable for or responsible in any way
for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any such sale or sales. The
Trustee may suspend such sales upon the occurrence of unusual or unforeseen
circumstances, including but not limited to a suspension in trading of a
Security, the closing or restriction of trading, the outbreak of hostilities, or
the collapse of the economy. Upon receipt of proceeds from the sale of the last
Security, the Trustee shall deduct therefrom its fees and all other expenses
(see "Expenses of the Trust"). The remaining amount shall be transmitted to the
Depository for distribution via the DTC Participants, together with a final
statement setting forth the computation of the gross amount distributed.
Nasdaq-100 Shares not redeemed prior to termination of the Trust will be
redeemed in cash at net asset value based on the proceeds of the sale of the
Securities. Such redemptions in cash at net asset value shall be available to
all Beneficial Owners, with no minimum aggregation of Nasdaq-100 Shares
required.

                      RESIGNATION, REMOVAL, AND LIABILITY

THE TRUSTEE

    Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may resign and be discharged of the
Trust created by the Trust Agreement by executing a notice of resignation in
writing and filing such notice with the Sponsor and mailing a copy of the notice
of resignation to all DTC Participants that are reflected on the records of the
Depository as owning Nasdaq-100 Shares, for distribution to Beneficial Owners as
provided above (see "The Trust--Book-Entry-Only System") not less than sixty
(60) days before the date such resignation is to take effect. Such resignation
will

                                      B-79
<Page>
become effective upon the appointment of and the acceptance of the Trust by a
successor Trustee or, if no successor is appointed within sixty (60) days after
the date such notice of resignation is given, the Trust shall terminate (see
"Administration of the Trust--Termination"). The Sponsor, upon receiving notice
of such resignation, is obligated to use its best efforts to appoint a successor
Trustee promptly.

    In case the Trustee becomes incapable of acting as such or is adjudged a
bankrupt or is taken over by any public authority, the Sponsor may discharge the
Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement.
Notice of such discharge and appointment shall be mailed by the Sponsor to the
Depository and the DTC Participants for distribution to Beneficial Owners.

    Upon a successor Trustee's execution of a written acceptance of an
appointment as Trustee for the Trust, such successor Trustee will become vested
with all the rights, powers, duties, and obligations of the original Trustee.

    A successor Trustee is required to be a bank, trust company, corporation, or
national banking association organized and doing business under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof, to be authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trust powers, and to have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus,
and undivided profit of not less than $50,000,000.

    Beneficial Owners of 51% of the then outstanding Nasdaq-100 Shares may at
any time remove the Trustee by written instrument(s) delivered to the Trustee
and the Sponsor. The Sponsor shall thereupon use its best efforts to appoint a
successor Trustee in the manner specified above and in the Trust Agreement.

    The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee is not liable for any action
taken in reasonable reliance on properly executed documents or for the
disposition of moneys or Securities or for the evaluations required to be made
thereunder, except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith, wilful
malfeasance, wilful misconduct, or reckless disregard of its duties and
obligations, nor is the Trustee liable or responsible in any way for
depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any
Securities in the Trust. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act, the
Trustee may act and is not liable for any such action taken by it in good faith.
The Trustee is not personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges
imposed upon or in respect of the Securities or upon the interest thereon or
upon it as Trustee or upon or in respect of the Trust which the Trustee may be
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America
or of any other taxing

                                      B-80
<Page>
authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust Agreement contains other
customary provisions limiting the liability of the Trustee. The Trustee and its
directors, subsidiaries, shareholders, officers, employees, and affiliates under
common control with the Trustee (each a "Trustee Indemnified Party") will be
indemnified from the assets of the Trust and held harmless against any loss,
liability, or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith, wilful
misconduct, wilful malfeasance on the part of such Trustee Indemnified Party, or
reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, arising out of, or in
connection with its acceptance or administration of the Trust, including the
costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of defending against any claim or
liability.

THE SPONSOR

    If at any time the Sponsor shall fail to undertake or perform or become
incapable of undertaking or performing any of the duties which by the terms of
the Trust Agreement are required of it to be undertaken or performed, or shall
resign, or shall become bankrupt or its affairs shall be taken over by public
authorities, the Trustee may appoint a successor Sponsor as shall be
satisfactory to the Trustee, agree to act as Sponsor itself, or may terminate
the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust (see "Administration of the
Trust--Termination"). Notice of the resignation or removal of the Sponsor and
the appointment of a successor shall be mailed by the Trustee to the Depository
and the DTC Participants for distribution to Beneficial Owners (see "The
Trust--Book-Entry-Only System"). Upon a successor Sponsor's execution of a
written acceptance of such appointment as Sponsor of the Trust, such successor
Sponsor shall become vested with all of the rights, powers, duties, and
obligations of the original Sponsor. Any successor Sponsor may be compensated at
rates deemed by the Trustee to be reasonable.

    The Sponsor may resign by executing and delivering to the Trustee an
instrument of resignation. Such resignation shall become effective upon the
appointment of a successor Sponsor and the acceptance of such appointment by the
successor Sponsor, unless the Trustee either agrees to act as Sponsor or
terminates the Trust Agreement and liquidates the Trust, which the Trustee shall
do if no successor Sponsor is appointed (see "Administration of the
Trust--Termination").

    The dissolution of the Sponsor or its ceasing to exist as a legal entity for
any reason whatsoever will not cause the termination of the Trust Agreement or
the Trust unless the Trustee deems termination to be in the best interests of
the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares.

                                      B-81
<Page>
    The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor is not liable to the Trustee,
the Trust, or to the Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares for taking any
action or for refraining from taking any action made in good faith or for errors
in judgment, but is liable only for its own gross negligence, bad faith, wilful
misconduct, or wilful malfeasance in the performance of its duties or its
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement. The
Sponsor is not liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by the Trust by reason of the sale of any Securities of the Trust. The
Trust Agreement further provides that the Sponsor and its directors,
subsidiaries, shareholders, officers, employees, and affiliates under common
control with the Sponsor (each a "Sponsor Indemnified Party") shall be
indemnified from the assets of the Trust and held harmless against any loss,
liability, or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith, wilful
misconduct, or wilful malfeasance on the part of any Sponsor Indemnified Party
in the performance of its duties or reckless disregard of its obligations and
duties under the Trust Agreement, including the payment of the costs and
expenses (including counsel fees) of defending against any claim or liability.

                   SECONDARY MARKET TRADING, NET ASSET SIZE,
                         PERFORMANCE, AND TAX TREATMENT

    Information regarding various aspects of the Trust, including the net asset
size thereof, as well as the secondary market trading, the performance, and the
tax treatment of Nasdaq-100 Shares, may be included from time to time in
advertisements, sales literature, and other communications as well as in reports
to current or prospective Beneficial Owners.

    Information may be provided to prospective investors to help such investors
assess their specific investment goals and to aid in their understanding of
various financial strategies. Such information may present current economic and
political trends and conditions and may describe general principles of investing
such as asset allocation, diversification, and risk tolerance, as well as
specific investment techniques such as indexing and hedging. In addition,
information may be presented to prospective or current Beneficial Owners
regarding the

                                      B-83
<Page>
purchase of Nasdaq-100 Shares in the secondary market, such as margin

"minus" or "zero-minus" ticks. Selling short refers to the sale of securities
which the seller does not own, but which the seller arranges to borrow prior to
effecting the sale. Institutional investors may be advised that lending their
Nasdaq-100 Shares to short sellers may generate stock loan credits which may
supplement the return they can earn from an investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares.
These stock loan credits may provide a useful source of additional income for
certain institutional investors who can arrange to lend Nasdaq-100 Shares.
Potential short sellers may be advised that a short rebate (functionally
equivalent to partial use of proceeds of the short sale) may reduce their cost
of selling short.

    Information may be provided to investors regarding capital gains
distributions by the Trust, including historical information relating to such
distributions. Comparisons between the Trust and other investment vehicles such
as mutual funds may be made regarding such capital gains distributions, as well
as relative tax efficiencies between the Trust and such other investment
vehicles (E.G., realization of capital gains or losses to the Trust and to such
other investment vehicles in connection with redemption of their respective
securities). (See "Tax Status of the Trust"

                                      B-84
<Page>
for discussion of tax consequences to Beneficial Owners of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
connection with the sale or redemption of Nasdaq-100 Shares.) Based on projected
differences between Nasdaq-100 Shares and conventional mutual funds with regard
to capital gains distributions, projections may be made regarding comparative
capital gains distributions and tax rates for taxable investors holding
Nasdaq-100 Shares over a long period of time. Comparisons may also be provided
regarding the probable tax impact resulting from rebalancing of the Trust
portfolio (see "The Portfolio--Adjustments to the Portfolio") and adjustments to
the portfolio of an actively managed investment vehicle.

    Specifically, information may be provided to prospective or current
investors comparing and contrasting the tax efficiencies of conventional mutual
funds with Nasdaq-100 Shares. Both conventional mutual funds and the Trust may
be required to recognize capital gains incurred as a result of adjustments to
the composition and weighting of the Index and therefore to their respective
portfolios. From a tax perspective, however, a significant difference between a
conventional mutual fund and the Trust is the process by which their shares are
redeemed. In cases where a conventional mutual fund experiences redemptions in
excess of subscriptions ("net redemptions") and has insufficient cash available
to fund such net redemptions, such fund may have to sell stocks held in its
portfolio to raise and pay cash to redeeming shareholders. A mutual fund will
generally experience a taxable gain or loss when it sells such portfolio stocks
in order to pay cash to redeeming fund shareholders. In contrast, the redemption
mechanism for Nasdaq-100 Shares does not ordinarily involve selling the
Securities held by the Trust in the event of a redemption. Instead, the Trust
delivers an actual portfolio of securities in an "in-kind" exchange to any
person redeeming Nasdaq-100 Shares in Creation Unit size aggregations (I.E.,
50,000 Nasdaq-100 Shares per Creation Unit). While this "in-kind" exchange is a
taxable transaction to the redeeming entity (usually a broker/dealer) making the
exchange, it generally does not constitute a taxable transaction at the Trust
level and, consequently, there is no realization of taxable gain or loss by the
Trust with respect to such "in-kind" exchanges. In a period of market
appreciation of the Index and, consequently, appreciation of Nasdaq-100 Shares,
this "in-kind" redemption mechanism has the effect of eliminating the
recognition and distribution of those net unrealized gains at the Trust level.
Investors should note that although the same result would occur for conventional
mutual funds utilizing an "in-kind" redemption mechanism, the opportunities to
redeem fund shares by delivering portfolio stocks "in-kind" are limited in most
mutual funds.

    Investors may be informed that, while no unequivocal statement can be made
as to the net tax impact on a conventional mutual fund resulting

                                      B-85
<Page>
from the purchases and sales of its portfolio stocks over a period of time,
conventional funds that have accumulated substantial unrealized capital gains,
if they experience net redemptions and do not have sufficient available cash,
may be required to make taxable capital gains distributions that are generated
by changes in such fund's portfolio. In contrast, the "in-kind" redemption
mechanism of Nasdaq-100 Shares may make them more tax efficient investments
under most circumstances than comparable conventional mutual fund shares. As
discussed above, the "in-kind" redemption feature of the Trust tends to lower
the amount of annual net capital gains distributions to Nasdaq-100 Share holders
as compared to their conventional mutual fund counterparts. Since shareholders
are generally required to pay income tax on capital gains distributions, the
smaller the amount of such distributions, the less taxes that are payable
currently. To the extent that the Trust is not required to recognize capital
gains, the Nasdaq-100 Share holder is able, in effect, to defer tax on such
gains until he sells or otherwise disposes of his shares, or the Trust
terminates. If such holder retains his shares until his death, under current law
the tax basis of such shares would be adjusted to their then fair market value.

    Information regarding the secondary market trading activity of Nasdaq-100
Shares also may be presented over one or more stated time periods, such as for
daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual periods. Nasdaq-100 Share secondary market
trading volume information may be compared with similar information relating to
other issues trading on the Amex during the same reporting period. Average daily
secondary market trading volume of Nasdaq-100 Shares may also be reported from
time to time. Comparisons of such information during various periods may also be
made, and may be expressed by means of percentages.

    Information may also be provided in communications to prospective investors
or current Beneficial Owners comparing and contrasting the relative advantages
of investing in Nasdaq-100 Shares as compared to other investment vehicles, such
as mutual funds, both on an individual and a group basis (E.G., stock index
mutual funds). Such information may include comparisons of costs and expense
ratios, expressed either in dollars or basis points, stock lending activities,
permitted investments and hedging activities (E.G., engaging in options or
futures transactions), and portfolio turnover data and analyses. In addition,
such information may quote, reprint, or include portions of financial,
scholarly, or business publications or periodicals, including model allocation
schedules or portfolios, as the foregoing relate to the comparison of Nasdaq-100
Shares to other investment vehicles, current economic, financial and political
conditions, investment philosophy or techniques, or the desirability of owning
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

                                      B-86

    In addition, information on the performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares on the
basis of changes in price per Nasdaq-100 Share with or without reinvesting all
dividends, if any, and/or any distributions of capital in additional Nasdaq-100
Shares may be included from time to time in such information. Average annualized
performance may be stated for various periods. Total return figures may also be
stated for a period from the Initial Date of Deposit, a date at least twelve
months prior to the end of the reporting period or for annual periods for the
life of the Trust. Total return measures the percentage growth in the total
dollar value of an investment in Nasdaq-100 Shares (reflecting dividends, if
any, and capital appreciation but without provision for any income taxes
payable).


    Information on the Index contained in this Prospectus, as updated from time
to time, may also be included from time to time in such material. The
performance of the Trust, of the Index (provided information is also given
reflecting the performance of the Trust in comparison to the Index) or both may
also be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in market
surveys such as SEI Fund Evaluation Survey (a leading database of tax-exempt
funds) or mutual funds such as those reported by Lipper Analytical
Services Inc., Money Magazine Fund Watch, Wiesenberger Investment Companies
Service, Morningstar Incorporated, and Value Line Investment Survey, each of
which measures performance following their own specific and well-defined
calculation measures, or of the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the
American Stock Exchange Composite Index, the Nasdaq Composite Index (indices of
stocks traded on the New York and American Stock Exchanges and The Nasdaq Stock
Market, respectively), the S&P 500 Index-Registered Trademark- (a broad-based
index of 500 publicly traded companies), the S&P MidCap 400 Index-TM- (a
broad-based index of 400 publicly traded middle capitalization companies), the
Dow Jones Industrial Average(SM) (an index currently comprising 30 publicly
traded large capitalization companies), or similar domestic or foreign
measurement standards during the same period of time. In addition to all other
sources of comparative information, comparative performance figures published by
other funds or money managers may be included from time to time. Information may
also be included regarding the aggregate amount of assets committed to index
investing generally by various types of investors, such as pension funds and
other institutional investors, which currently exceeds $300 billion.


    Information on the relative price performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares in
relation to other securities and/or indices may be represented in the form of
"correlation." Correlation is a standard measure of the degree of linear
association between two price series, and ranges from minus one hundred percent
(-100%) (I.E., perfect negative linear association) to

                                      B-87
<Page>
positive one hundred percent (100%) (I.E., perfect positive linear association).

    One important difference between Nasdaq-100 Shares and conventional mutual
fund shares is that Nasdaq-100 Shares are available for purchase or sale on an
intraday basis on the Amex. An investor who buys shares in a conventional mutual
fund will usually buy or sell shares at a price at or related to the closing net
asset value per share, as determined by the fund. In contrast, Nasdaq-100 Shares
are not offered for purchase or redeemed for cash at a fixed relationship to
closing NAV. The tables below illustrate the distribution relationships of daily
pricing data for Nasdaq-100 Shares, NAV and the Nasdaq-100 Index for the 2000
calendar year. These tables may help investors compare the trading costs and
intraday trading risks of Nasdaq-100 Shares to funds sold and redeemed at prices
related to closing NAV.

    Investors who purchase or sell Nasdaq-100 Shares may wish to evaluate the
volatility of the price of Nasdaq-100 Shares during the trading day. To assist
investors in making such an evaluation, the Daily Percentage Price Range table
illustrates the volatility of price movements for both Nasdaq-100 Shares and the
Nasdaq-100 Index on a daily basis. Investors who purchase or sell Nasdaq-100
Shares may also wish to evaluate the opportunity to buy or sell on an intraday
basis versus the assurance of a transaction at or related to closing NAV. To
assist investors in making this comparison, the High and Low Price versus
Closing Value table illustrates the possibility of buying or selling Nasdaq-100
Shares at prices less or more favorable than closing NAV.

    Investors may wish to evaluate the potential of Nasdaq-100 Shares to
approximate the value of the assets in the Trust as a basis of valuation of the
shares. The Closing Price versus NAV table illustrates the closing value of
Nasdaq-100 Shares in relation to the underlying value of the assets in the Trust
on a daily basis. Additionally, the NAV versus Nasdaq-100 Index table shows the
difference between the underlying value of assets in the Trust and the
Nasdaq-100 Index based on month-end values.

    Finally, investors may wish to consider the average bid/asked spread on
Nasdaq-100 Shares, as illustrated in the Bid/Ask Spread table, and add any
commissions charged by a broker to determine the direct costs of trading
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    The information provided in the following tables with respect to the
Nasdaq-100 Shares (including price ranges, relationship of prices to closing
NAV, and bid/asked spreads) may vary materially over time.

                                      B-88
<Page>
There is some evidence, for example, that the bid/asked spread will widen in
more volatile markets and narrow when markets are less volatile.

    The price range of Nasdaq-100 Shares for the 2000 calendar year was from
$54.25 to $120.50; consequently, a spread of 1/8 represents from 0.23% to 0.10%
of the share price.

    Information relating to the relative price performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares
may be compared against a wide variety of investment categories and asset
classes, including common stocks, small capitalization stocks, long and
intermediate term corporate and government bonds, Treasury bills, the rate of
inflation in the United States (based on the Consumer Price Index ("CPI")) and
combinations of various capital markets. Historical returns of these and other
capital markets in the United States may be provided by independent statistical
studies and sources, such as those provided by Ibbotson Associates of Chicago,
Illinois. The performance of these capital markets is based on the returns of
different indices. Information may be presented using the performance of these
and other capital markets to demonstrate general investment strategies. For
example, the performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares may be compared to the performance
of selected asset classes such as short-term U.S. Treasury bills, long-term U.S.
Treasury bonds, long-term corporate bonds, mid-capitalization stocks, foreign
stocks, and small capitalization stocks and may also be measured against the
rate of inflation as set forth in well-known indices (such as the CPI).
Performance comparisons may also include the value of a hypothetical investment
in any of these capital markets. Performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares may also be
compared to that of other indices or compilations that may be developed and made

                                      B-91
<Page>
available to the investing public in the future. Of course, such comparisons
will only reflect past performance of Nasdaq-100 Shares and the investment
categories, indices, or compilations chosen, and no guarantees can be made of
future results regarding the performance of either Nasdaq-100 Shares or the
asset classes chosen for such comparisons.

                         DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT SERVICE

    The Sponsor reserves the right in the future to make the DTC book-entry
Dividend Reinvestment Service (the "Service") available for use by Beneficial
Owners through DTC Participants for reinvestment of their cash proceeds, if any.
The Sponsor may choose to make the Service available within its discretion and
without the consent of Beneficial Owners. Some or all DTC Participants may not
elect to utilize the Service; therefore, if the Service is made available for
Nasdaq-100 Shares, an interested Nasdaq-100 Share investor may wish to contact
his or her broker to ascertain the availability of the Service through such
broker at such time. Interested Beneficial Owners should also note that each
broker may require investors to adhere to specific procedures and timetables in
order to participate in the Service and investors should ascertain from their
broker such necessary details at the time when the Service is made available for
Nasdaq-100 Shares.

    If and when the Service is utilized, the Trustee may use the cash proceeds
of dividends received from all Beneficial Owners participating in reinvestment
through the Service to obtain Index Securities necessary to create the requisite
number of Nasdaq-100 Shares at the close of business on each Nasdaq-100 Share
distribution date. Alternatively, the Trustee may choose to implement the
reinvestment of dividends through other means (E.G., through trade executions
for Nasdaq-100 Shares on the open market). Any cash balance remaining after the
requisite number of Nasdaq-100 Shares have been created or otherwise acquired
will be distributed, on a pro rata basis, to all Beneficial Owners who
participated in the Service. Brokerage commissions, if any, incurred in
obtaining the Index Securities necessary to create additional Nasdaq-100 Shares
with the cash from the distributions, or in purchasing Nasdaq-100 Shares on the
open market, will be an expense of the Trust.

    Nasdaq-100 Shares acquired pursuant to the Service will be held by the
Beneficial Owners in the same manner, and subject to the same terms and
conditions, as original ownership of Nasdaq-100 Shares. Distributions reinvested
in additional Nasdaq-100 Shares through the Service will nevertheless be taxable
dividends to Beneficial Owners to the same extent as if received in cash.
